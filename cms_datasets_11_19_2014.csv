Annual Survey of Manufactures,Census Bureau Survey - no sponsorship,Bureau of the Census,Business,Annually,Calendar Year,Establishment,Bureau of the Census,y,"The Annual Survey of Manufactures is collected under the authority of Title 13, United States Code","The Annual Survey of Manufactures sample has ranged from as low as 50,000 establishments to as high as 75,000 establishments over the period of 1973 to present.",Manufacturing,"The Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) covers NAICS sectors 31 through 33, which are designated as Manufacturing.",http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/asm/index.html,"The Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) provides sample estimates of statistics for all manufacturing establishments with one or more paid employee. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the ASM in each of the 4 years between the economic census which is collected for years ending in 2 and 7. Among the statistics included in this survey are: employment, payroll, value added by manufacture, cost of materials consumed, value of shipments, detailed capital expenditures, supplemental labor costs, fuels and electric energy used, and inventories by stage of fabrication.","The Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) provides sample estimates of statistics for all manufacturing establishments with one or more paid employee. Manufacturing is defined as the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials or substances into new products. The assembly of components into new products is also considered manufacturing, except when it is appropriately classified as construction.

Establishments in the manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and typically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. Also included in the manufacturing sector are some establishments that make products by hand, such as custom tailors and the makers of custom draperies. While manufacturers typically do not sell to the public, some establishments such as bakeries and candy stores that make products on the premises may be included.

The Census Bureau conducts the ASM in each of the 4 years between the economic census which is collected for years ending in 2 and 7. The economic census is the sample frame from which the ASM is chosen and presents more detailed data than the ASM.

Each of the establishments canvassed in the ASM are classified in 1 of 473 manufacturing industries in accordance with the industry definitions in the 1997 NAICS Manual.

In the NAICS system, an industry is generally defined as a group of establishments that have similar production processes. To the extent practical, the system uses supply based or production-oriented concepts in defining industries. The resulting group of establishments must be significant in terms of number, value added by manufacture, value of shipments, and number of employees.

In the 1997 Manufacturing Economic Census, all establishments were classified in particular industries based on the products they produced. If an establishment made products of more than one industry, it was classified in the industry with the largest product value.

The ASM is conducted on an establishment basis. A company operating at more than one location is required to file a separate report for each location or establishment selected in the sample. Companies engaged in distinctly different lines of activity at one location are requested to submit separate reports if the plant records permit such a separation and if the activities are substantial in size.

Occasionally, special supplemental questions are added to the ASM in order to collect information on specific topics of interest.  For example,
detailed information on fuels consumed:  quantity and cost of coal, coke, distillate fuel oil, residual fuel oil, natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gases were collected as part of the 1975-81 ASM.  Supplemental information on the use of computer networks for ordering supplies, managing
inventories, and managing sales, etc. were collected as part of the 1999 and 2000 ASM.

","Traditionally, The Census Bureaus objective for the ASM was to publish the most useful and accurate aggragate statistics for the survey year. The survey processors were concerned with individual establishments records only as they impact the aggreagates or the tests for confidentiality. As a result, many uncorrected nonsampling errors, and data anamolies remain in the data files. Many records contain improper company affiliation, omitted data, or erroneous data not judged to impact the aggregate statistics. Although the aggreagates are relatively unaffected, these microdata records could be significant when considered in light of a time series comparison, particularly if those comparisons are related to the size of the firm. 

The adoption of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) in the 1997 Economic Census has had a major impact on the comparability of current and historic data. Approximately half of the industries in the manufacturing sector of NAICS do not have comparable industries in the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system that was used in the past.

While most of the change affecting the manufacturing sector was change within the sector, some industries left manufacturing and others came into manufacturing. Prominent among those that left manufacturing are logging and portions of publishing. Prominent among the industries that came into the manufacturing sector are bakeries, candy stores where candy is made on the premises, custom tailors, makers of custom draperies, and tire retreading. 

All dollar values presented are expressed in current dollars. Consequently, when making comparisons with prior years, users of the data should consider the changes in prices that have occurred.

Data for cost of materials and value of shipments include varying amounts of duplication, especially at higher levels of aggregation. This is because the products of one establishment may be the materials of another. The value added statistics avoid this duplication and are, for most purposes, the best measure for comparing the relative economic importance of industries and geographic areas.

In ASM years, establishments included in the ASM sample with certainty weights are reclassified by industry only if the change in the primary activity from the prior year is significant or if the change has occurred for two successive years. This procedure prevents reclassification when there are minor shifts in product mix.

In ASM years, establishments included in the ASM sample with noncertainty weight are not shifted from one industry classification to another. They are retained in the industry where they were classified in the base census year. However, in the following census year, these ASM plants are allowed to shift from one industry to another.

The results of these rules covering the switching of plants from one industry classification to another are that some industries comprise different mixes of establishments in different survey years. Hence, comparisons between prior-year and current-year published totals, particularly at the six-digit NAICS level, should be viewed with caution. This is particularly true for the comparison between the data shown for a census year versus the data shown for the previous ASM year.

Improved Longitudinal linkages - In contructing the LBD, great care was taken to provide researchers with the most complete and accurate set of longitudinal establishment linkages possible.  This substantially reduces the number spurious establishment births and deaths observed in the data.  In addition, the LBD provides researchers with detailed flags that describe, for each establishment, the nature of the linkages over each year an establishment is observed in the data.

Basic establishment demographic data - The LBD contains basic information on establishment size, industry, location and ownership that permit researchers to analyze establishment demographics.

Linkages to other micro data - The research capabilities of the LBD can be greatly and easily enhanced by linking it to other establishment and firm information contained in Economic Census and survey files available at CES and the RDCs.

<p>Small employers, i.e., single-establishment firms with payroll below a specified cutoff, are not selected into the small employer sample. Although the payroll cutoff varies by kind of business, small employers not sent a report form generally include firms with less than 10 employees and represent about 10 percent of total revenue of establishments covered in the census.  Data on revenue, payroll, and employment for these small employers were derived or estimated from administrative records of other federal agencies.

These data are the primary source of detailed facts about the Nations Construction Industry. The CCI covers all employer establishments primarily engaged in construction as defined by the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

The companies included in the 1997 CCN were identified as part of a normal Economic Census operation. Construction companies were divided into employers (companies with payroll) and nonemployers (companies without payroll). Statistical information for the employers was obtained in the census by a survey which included medium size and large employers and a sample of the smaller ones. Census reports were not required from the nonemployers. Statistics on nonemployers were obtained from administrative records of other agencies of the Federal Government.

Data collected in the construction census include employment (construction worker and other), payroll, value of construction work, cost of materials, supplies and fuels, cost of work subcontracted out, capital expenditures, assets and type of construction.
","Data from the 1997 Economic Census are published primarily on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), unlike earlier censuses, which were published according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. NAICS is in the process of being adopted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Completion of four items on the questionnaire are mandated by law.

b. Respondents

The Survey of Industrial Research and Development is an annual sample survey that intends to include or represent all for-profit R&D-performing companies, either publicly or privately held. The survey is completed by representatives at manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies known to conduct R&D and by representatives from samples of companies in both sectors that may conduct R&D. A company is defined as one or more establishments under common ownership or control. In some cases representatives at the establishment level return forms, so that more than one form per company is returned. In these cases, company data are aggregated during processing.

2. Survey Design 

a. Target population and sample frame

The target population consists of all industrial companies that perform R&D in the United States. The Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), a Bureau of the Census compilation that contains information on more than 3 million establishments with paid employees, is the target population from which the frame used to select the survey sample is created. For companies with more than one establishment, data were summed to the company level. The frame from which the survey sample is drawn includes all for-profit companies classified in nonfarm industries. For surveys prior to 1992, the frame was limited to companies above certain size criteria based on number of employees. These criteria varied by industry. Some industries were excluded from the frame because it was believed that they contributed little or no R&D activity to the final survey estimates. For the 1992 sample, new industries were added to the frame, and the size criteria were lowered considerably and applied uniformly to firms in all industries. As a result, nearly 2 million enterprises with 5 or more employees were given a chance of selection for subsequent samples, including the 1998 sample. For comparison, the frame for the 1987 sample included 154,000 companies of specified sizes and industries.

b. Sample design

For the 1998 survey, each firm was assigned a single Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code based on the activity of the establishment having the highest dollar value of payroll. This assignment was done on a hierarchical basis. The enterprise was first assigned to the economic division (manufacturing or nonmanufacturing) based on the aggregated payroll of its establishments, then to the 2-digit SIC code with the highest payroll within the assigned division, then to the 3-digit SIC code with the highest payroll within the assigned 2-digit industry.

Sampling Strata. A fundamental change initiated in 1995 and repeated for subsequent samples was the redefinition of the sampling strata. For the survey years 1992-94, 165 sampling strata were established, each stratum corresponding to one or more 3-digit-level SIC codes. The objective was to select sufficient representation of industries to determine whether alternative or expanded publication levels were warranted. Starting with the 1995 survey, the sampling strata corresponded to publication level industry aggregations; 40 publication levels were defined. These correspond to the original 25 groupings of manufacturing industries used as sampling strata before 1992 and an additional 15 groupings of nonmanufacturing industries. Companies were assigned to strata based on their 3-digit SIC codes.

Certainty Companies. The criteria for identifying companies selected for the survey with certainty, which were most recently modified in 1996, have remained the same for subsequent surveys. To limit the growth occurring each year in the number of certainty cases within the total sample, the certainty criterion was raised for the 1996 survey from $1 million to $5 million in total R&D expenditures. With a fixed total sample size, there was concern that the representation of the very large noncertainty universe by a smaller sample each year would be inadequate. Before 1994, companies with 1,000 or more employees had been selected with certainty, but it was observed that the level of spending varied considerably and that many of these companies reported no R&D expenditures each year. For these reasons, it was determined that these companies should be given chances of selection based upon the size of their R&D spending if they were in the previous survey or upon an estimated R&D value if they were not. Consequently, the size criteria were dropped for surveys after 1994.

Frame Partitioning. Partitioning of the frame into large and small companies was first introduced in 1994 because of concern arising from a study of 1992 survey results which showed that a disproportionate number of small companies was being selected for the sample, and often assigned very large weights. These small companies seldom reported R&D activity. This disproportion was a result of the minimum probability rule used as part of the independent probability proportionate to size (pps) sampling procedure employed exclusively prior to 1994. This rule increased the probabilities of selection for several hundred thousand smaller companies. For 1994 and subsequent surveys, simple random sampling (srs) was applied to the smaller company partition causing the smaller companies to be sampled more efficiently than with independent pps sampling since there was little variability in their size. The large partition continued to be sampled using independent pps sampling. In 1994 and 1995, total company payroll was the basis for partitioning the frame. For each industry grouping, the largest companies representing the top 90 percent of the total payroll for the industry grouping were included in the pps frame. The balance, the smaller companies comprising the remaining 10 percent of payroll for the industry grouping, were included in the srs frame. Beginning in 1996, total company employment became the basis for partitioning the frame. The total company employment levels defining the partitions were based on the relative contribution to total R&D expenditures of companies in different employment size groups in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. In the manufacturing sector, all companies with total employment of 50 or more were included in the large company partition. In the nonmanufacturing sector, all companies with total employment of 15 or more were included in the large company partition. Companies in the respective sectors with employment below these values were included in the small company partition. In the 1998 survey, the large company partition contained almost 550,000 companies and the small company partition contained approximately 1.3 million companies. These counts were comparable to those in the 1997 survey (540,000 and 1.3 million, respectively).

""Zero"" industries. One final modification in the frame development for 1996, which was repeated for subsequent surveys, was the designation of ""zero industries"" in the large company partition. Zero industries were those three-digit SIC industries having no R&D expenditures reported in survey years 1992-1994-the years when estimates by three-digit SIC industry were formed. These industries remained within the scope of the survey, but only a limited sample was drawn from them because it was unlikely that these industries conducted R&D. Simple random sampling was used to control the number of companies selected from these industries.

Sample Selection. In 1996 a significant revision in the procedure for selecting samples from the partitions led to a change in the development and presentation of estimates. The revised procedure was repeated for subsequent surveys. In 1995 the sample of companies from the large company partition was selected using probability proportionate to size sampling in each of the 40 strata. Likewise, the simple random sampling of the small company partition was done for each of the 40 strata. However, beginning in 1996, the number of strata established for the small company partition was reduced to two. One stratum consisted of small companies classified in manufacturing industries and the second stratum consisted of small companies classified in nonmanufacturing industries. Simple random sampling continued as the selection method for these two strata. The purpose of selecting the small company panel from these two strata was to reduce the variability in industry estimates largely attributed to the random year-to-year selection of small companies by industry and the high sampling weights that sometimes occurred. As a consequence of this change, estimates for industry groups within manufacturing and nonmanufacturing were not possible from these two strata as noted on affected tables. The statistics for the detailed industry groups were based only on the sample from the large company partition. Estimates from the small company partition were included in statistics for total manufacturing, total nonmanufacturing, and all industries. For completeness, in the affected tables the estimates also were added to the categories ""other manufacturing"" and ""other nonmanufacturing"".

c. Data collection techniques

The survey is conducted by the Census Bureau in accord with an interagency agreement with SRS. Survey instruments are mailed to company representatives in March each year with a request that they be completed by May 15. Five mail follow-ups are conducted. Phone follow-up is used with the 300 largest nonrespondent R&D performers (as determined by expenditures reported in previous surveys) that have not filed a request for extension. Two questionnaires are used each year to collect data for the survey. Known large R&D performers are sent a detailed questionnaire, Form RD-1. The Form RD-1 requests data on sales or receipts, total employment, employment of scientists and engineers, expenditures for R&D performed within the company with Federal funds and with company and other funds, character of work (basic research, applied research, and development), company-sponsored R&D expenditures in foreign countries, R&D performed under contract by others, Federally funded R&D by contracting agency, R&D costs by type of expense, domestic R&D expenditures by State, energy-related R&D and foreign R&D by country. Because companies receiving the Form RD-1 have participated in previous surveys, computer-imprinted data reported by the company for the previous year are supplied for reference. Companies are encouraged to revise or update this imprinted data if they have more current information, however prior-year statistics that had been previously published are revised only if large disparities were reported. Small R&D performers and firms included in the sample for the first time were sent Form RD-1A. This form collects the same information as Form RD-1 except for five items: Federal R&D support to the firm by contracting agency, R&D costs by type of expense, domestic R&D expenditures by State, energy-related R&D, and foreign R&D by country. It also includes a screening item that allows respondents to indicate that they do not perform R&D. No prior-year information is made available since the majority of the companies that receive the Form RD-1A have not been surveyed previously.

d. Estimation techniques

For various reasons, many firms chose to return the survey questionnaires with one or more blank items. For some firms, internal accounting systems and procedures may not have allowed quantification of specific expenditures. Others may have refused to answer any voluntary questions as a matter of company policy. When respondents did not provide the requested information, estimates for the missing data were made using imputation algorithms. In general, the imputation algorithms computed values for missing items by applying the average percentage change for the target item in the nonresponding firm's industry to the item's prior-year value for that firm, reported or imputed. This approach, with minor variation, was used for most items.

3. Survey Quality Measures top

a. Sampling variability

The sample is designed to produce coefficients of variation of 2 percent for industries designated as ""high priority"" industries and 5 percent for other industries. The designation of ""high priority"" is assigned when prior surveys have identified an industry as one in which there is a large amount of R&D expenditures.

b. Coverage

Coverage error constitutes a possible source of error for the survey because the SSEL is undoubtedly missing some in-scope companies, especially relatively new ones. It should be noted that coverage errors for surveys prior to 1992 were more likely, because not all companies on the SSEL were subject to selection. The Census Bureau continually strengthens and updates the SSEL so that coverage error is minimized..

c. Nonresponse

(1) Unit nonresponse - Of the companies surveyed for 1998, 13.2 percent did not respond. Nonresponse studies of companies that do not respond to the survey are conducted periodically to improve response rates in future surveys. Overall, the magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is negligible because even if no response can be elicited from a company, other sources of information about the company are used to estimate its R&D data.

(2) Item nonresponse - Companies are encouraged to estimate information when actual data are unavailable. Even so, item nonresponse rates for key data elements in the survey for 1998 ranged from 1.6 percent to 68.3 percent. When estimates are not reported and cannot be elicited by following up with the respondent, complex, comprehensive imputation techniques developed over the survey's long history are used to minimize the effects of item nonresponse.

d. Measurement

Variations in respondent interpretations of the definitions of R&D activities and variations in accounting procedures are of particular concern. Specifically, some companies have difficulty separating basic research from applied research, delineating the costs of fringe benefits attributable to R&D personnel, locating geographically where R&D is performed, and reporting the cost of energy R&D. The sophistication and comprehensiveness of a company's accounting system often depends on its size and activities and its willingness to accommodate Government-sponsored surveys. Work was conducted recently, using cognitive lab approaches, to evaluate ways in which the form could be modified to ease reporting difficulties and reduce measurement error. Recommendations resulting from that work continue to be incorporated into the survey questionnaires. Other ongoing efforts to minimize measurement error include questionnaire pre-testing, improvement of questionnaire wording and format, inclusion of more cues and examples in the questionnaire instructions, consultations with respondents, post-survey evaluations, record check studies, and computer editing.

4. Trend Data top

The statistics resulting from this survey are better indicators of changes in, rather than absolute levels of, R&D spending and personnel. Nevertheless, the statistics are often taken to be a continuous time series prepared using the same collection, processing, and tabulation methods. Such uniformity has not been the case. Since the survey was first fielded, improvements have been made to increase the reliability of the statistics and to make the survey results more useful. To that end, past practices have been changed and new procedures instituted. Preservation of the comparability of the statistics has, however, been an important consideration in making these improvements. Nonetheless, changes to survey definitions, the industry classification system, and the procedure used to assign industry codes to multi-establishment companies have had some, though not substantial, effects on the comparability of statistics. The aspect of the survey that had the greatest effect on comparability was the selection of samples at irregular intervals (i.e., 1967, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1987, and 1992) and the use of a subset or panel of the last sample drawn to develop statistics for intervening years. This practice introduced cyclical deterioration of the statistics. As compensation for this deterioration, periodic revisions were made to the statistics produced from the panels surveyed between sample years. Early in the survey's history, various methods were used to make these revisions. After 1976 and until the 1992 advent of annual sampling, a linking procedure called wedging was used. In wedging, the 2 sample years on each end of a series of estimates served as benchmarks in the algorithms used to adjust the estimates for the intervening years. To that end, the wedging algorithm does not change estimates from sample years and adjusts estimates from panel years, recognizing that deterioration of the panel is progressive over time. One of the primary reasons for deciding to select a new sample annually rather than at irregular intervals was to avoid applying global revision processes such as wedging. Consequently, the 1992 survey was intended to be the last one affected by the wedging procedure.

<p>The American Housing Survey (AHS) is the largest, regular national housing sample survey in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the AHS to obtain up-to-date housing statistics for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The AHS contains data on apartments, single-family homes, mobile homes, vacant homes, family composition, income, housing and neighborhood quality, housing costs, equipment, fuels, size of housing unit, and recent movers.</p>

<h4>Sample Density and Coverage</h4>

<p>National data are collected every other year, from a fixed sample of about 50,000 homes, plus new construction each year. The survey started in 1973, and has had the same sample since 1985, allowing users to see homes and households changing over the years. In some metropolitan areas the AHS has additional samples every 4-6 years, to measure local conditions.</p>

<p>The AHS conducts a national survey and a metropolitan area survey. Both surveys are conducted during a 3− to 7−month period. The national survey, which gathers information on housing throughout the country, interviews at about 55,000 housing units every 2 years, in odd−numbered years. The metropolitan area survey consists of 47 metropolitan areas, where householders are interviewed every 6 years. The AHS gathers data for about 14 metropolitan areas on an even numbered year until all 47 metropolitan areas are surveyed. The cycle begins again 6 years later. Every 4 years, six of the largest metropolitan areas are included with the national sample. Since 1984, each metropolitan area is represented by a sample of at least 3,200 designated housing units. The units are divided between the central city and the rest of the metropolitan area.</p>

<p>A sample of housing units in all survey areas was selected from the decennial census. These are updated by a sample of addresses obtained from building permits (for new construction) to include housing units added since the sample was selected. The homes in the national survey are located in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The survey goes back to the same housing units on a regular basis, recording changes in characteristics, adding and deleting units when applicable. This cross−sectioning of the housing inventory gives a picture of houses and households as they change over long periods of time.</p>",No survey was administered in 2006 and 2008.  2007 data will be posted by early 2011.  The AHS is now administered every other odd numbered year.,n,61,61

The United States is substituting Canadian import statistics for U.S. exports 
to Canada in accordance with a 1987 Memorandum of Understanding signed by the 
Census Bureau, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Canadian Customs, and 
Statistics Canada. Similarly, under this Memorandum of Understanding, Canada is 
substituting U.S. import statistics for Canadian exports to the United States. 
This data exchange includes only U.S. exports destined for Canada and does not 
include shipments destined for third countries by routes passing through Canada 
or shipments of certain grains and oilseeds to Canada for storage prior to 
exportation to a third country. These shipments are reported on and compiled 
from SED's.

Department of Defense Military Assistance Program Grant-Aid shipments being 
transported as Department of Defense cargo are reported directly to the U.S. 
Census Bureau by the Department of Defense.

Exports measure the total physical movement of merchandise out of the United 
States to foreign countries whether such merchandise is exported from within 
the U.S. Customs territory or from a U.S. Customs bonded warehouse or a U.S. 
Foreign Trade Zone. The following are examples of some types of shipments that 
are included in the statistics but are of such a nature that their inclusion 
merits separate mention:

�	Department of Defense Military Assistance Program Grant-Aid shipments 
under the Foreign Assistance Act

�	Foreign military sales.

�	Shipments of commodities for economic assistance under the Foreign 
Assistance Act. (Totals for exports under this program are published quarterly 
or as they become available.)

�	Shipments of agricultural commodities under P.L. 480 (Agricultural 
Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954) as amended, and related laws. 
(Totals for exports under this program are published as the data become 
available from the Department of Agriculture. Additional information may be 
obtained from the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture.) 

�	Sales of U.S. vessels to purchasers in foreign countries. 

�	Satellites launched by U.S. space vehicles limited to: (1) foreign 
origin, and/or; (2) launched on behalf of international organizations.

Domestic Exports
Exports of domestic merchandise include commodities which are grown, produced 
or manufactured in the United States, and commodities of foreign origin which 
have been changed in the United States, including U.S. Foreign Trade Zones, 
from the form in which they were imported, or which have been enhanced in value 
by further manufacture in the United States.


Foreign Exports (Re-exports)
Exports of foreign merchandise (re-exports), consist of commodities of foreign 
origin which have entered the United States for consumption or into Customs 
bonded warehouses or U.S. Foreign Trade Zones, and which, at the time of 
exportation, are in substantially the same condition as when imported.

forms and Foreign Trade Zone documents as required by law to be filed with the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Data on imports of electricity and natural

Imports of merchandise include commodities of foreign origin as well as goods 
of domestic origin returned to the United States with no change in condition or 
after having been processed and/or assembled in other countries. 
(See discussion of American Goods Returned After Processing And/Or Assembly below).

For statistical purposes, imports are classified by the type of transaction:

�	Merchandise entered for immediate consumption. (""duty free"" 
merchandise and merchandise on which duty is paid on arrival).  

�	Merchandise withdrawn for consumption from Customs bonded warehouses, 
and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones. 

�	Merchandise entered into Customs bonded warehouses and U.S. Foreign 
Trade Zones from foreign countries.

Bonded Warehouses
Bonded warehouses are authorized by U.S. Customs for storage or manufacturing 
of goods on which payment of duties is deferred until the goods are removed 
into Customs Territory. These goods are not subject to duties if reshipped to 
foreign points.


Foreign Trade Zones
Foreign Trade Zones are enclosed areas, operated as public utilities, under 
control of U.S. Customs with facilities for handling, storing, manipulating, 
manufacturing, and exhibiting goods. The merchandise may be exported, 
destroyed, or sent into Customs territory from the zone, in the original 
package or otherwise. It is subject to Customs duties if sent into Customs 
territory, but not if reshipped to foreign points.

American Goods Returned After Processing and/or Assembly
Domestically produced goods are shipped from the United States to other 
countries for processing and/or assembly and then returned to this country. 
Imports containing U.S. content which qualify for special duty-free treatment 
on the U.S. portion fall into the following groups:

�	Articles of metal manufactured in the United States, which were 
exported for further processing abroad and returned to the United States for 
more processing. 


�	Textile articles assembled abroad and entered under a Special Access 
Program or Special Regime. 

�	Articles assembled abroad from components produced in the United 
States, except textile articles entered under a Special Access Program or 
Special Regime.

Separate statistics are available on American goods returned after processing 
and/or assembly abroad.

General Imports
""General Imports"" measure the total physical arrivals of merchandise from 
foreign countries, whether such merchandise enters consumption channels 
immediately or is entered into bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones under 
Customs custody.



Imports for Consumption
""Imports for Consumption"" measure the total of merchandise that has physically 
cleared through Customs either entering consumption channels immediately or 
entering after withdrawal for consumption from bonded warehouses under Customs 
custody or from Foreign Trade Zones. Many countries use the term ""special 
imports"" to designate statistics compiled on this basis.

These files allow outside researchers and analysts to conduct independent analyses and research. The goal of NCHS is to maximize data release through public use files. Public use files provide the greatest access to NCHS data for the largest number of users. However, any release of data, whether micro data files or the results of statistical analyses, must be consistent with the confidentiality provisions under which the data were collected. In the case of data collected or obtained by NCHS, Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m(d)) and the NCHS Staff Manual on Confidentiality do not permit the release of data that are either identified or identifiable to persons outside of NCHS. In order to preserve privacy and confidentiality, details that might identify or facilitate the identification of persons and organizations participating in surveys and data systems are suppressed in published data products. Examples of data elements that might be abridged are geographic identifiers, details of sample design, and variables such as age or income that might exist in other databases.
Despite the wide dissemination of data through publications, CD-ROMs, web release and other mechanisms, the inability to release files with, for instance, lower levels of geography, severely limits the utility of some data for research, policy, and programmatic purposes and sets a boundary on one of the goals of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, i.e., to increase our capacity to provide state and local area estimates. In pursuit of this goal and in response to the research community's interest in accessing data that cannot be released using public use products because these data could be used to determine the identity of an individual or establishment (these data are referred to as confidential or restricted), NCHS established the Research Data Center (RDC). The RDC provides a mechanism whereby researchers can access detailed data files in a secure environment, without jeopardizing the confidentiality of respondents.

","Description of Full NLMS Project:

The National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) consists of a database 
developed for the purpose of studying the effects of demographic and socio-
economic characteristics on differentials in U.S. mortality rates. The NLMS is 
a unique research database in that it is based on a random sample of the non-
institutionalized population of the United States.  It consists of U.S. Census 
Bureau data from Current Population Surveys, Annual Social and Economic 
Supplements and the 1980 Census combined with death certificate information to 
identify mortality status and cause of death. The study currently consists of 
approximately 2.3 million records with over 250,000 identified mortality 
cases.  The content of the socio-economic variables available offers 
researchers the potential to answer questions on mortality differentials for a 
variety of important socio-economic and demographic subgroups not covered as 
extensively in other databases. This project has generated over 50 publications 
in various prominent scholarly, scientific and public health related journals



Project Objective:


To provide an analytical research database for the purpose of studying the 
effect of socio-economic differentials on mortality.  Specific objectives of 
this project are:


1.	To provide answers to specific public health questions which are not 
available from other sources. 

2.	To publish research findings in scholarly, scientific and health 
related journals. 

3.	To release a public-use file.  This file will be released only after 
extensive review to ensure that the confidentiality of respondents has been 
protected.  The release of the public-use file must be approved by the Census 
Bureau�s Disclosure Review Board and organizations contributing data to the 
file. 


Confidentiality of NLMS data: 

The assurance of confidentiality of Census Bureau data is provided by Title 13 
of the United States Code (U.S.C.). As such, NLMS operational procedures 
carefully follow well-defined practices designed to maintain the 
confidentiality of personal records as required by Title 13. These practices 
include the prevention of disclosure through the elimination of sparse cells in 
publications, the prohibited release of small-area geographical information on 
the NLMS public-use file, the use of an individually assigned NLMS control 
number to identify records instead of the use of personal identifiers for these 
purposes, and the restriction of persons having direct access to the NLMS 
database. A violation of Title 13 includes assessment of severe penalties 
including a prison term of up to 5 years and/or fines of up to $250,000, for 
any individual found guilty of releasing confidential information. In addition, 
any data acquired for NLMS purposes from an external agency is acquired under 
strict confidentiality protections and agreements that govern its use and 
subsequent release.


Sponsoring Organizations: 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
The National Institute on Aging (NIA), and 
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
The U.S. Census Bureau (CB) is a non-funding sponsor of the NLMS.
</pre>
","1.	The NLMS is based on specific survey months of the Current Population Survey, the Annual Social and Economic Supplement, and a subset of the 1980 Census. These are one-time data collection processes with no subsequent data collection.  Therefore, one limitation of NLMS data is that they provide a one-time only baseline measurement of subjects in a long-term follow-up situation. Another limitation of these data is that, although the CPS and census instruments do provide extensive data collection capabilities in specific subject matter areas, desirable general or specific health information is not collected, and smoking status is available on only a limited number of records.

2.	The version of the NLMS available to qualified RDC researchers contains mortality follow-ups for 1979-1989 and does not contain the NDI follow-ups through 1998 that are available in the public-use file.  However, the public-use file does not contain the detailed geographic information available on the RDC file.

","<h4>PURPOSE</h4>

To provide periodic and comprehensive statistics about retail establishments and activities. The United States Code, Title 13, requires this census and provides for mandatory responses.

<h4>COVERAGE</h4>

Domestic establishments with payroll that retail merchandise, generally without transformation, and related services. These are all establishments classified in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 44-45, Retail Trade. In 1997, over 1.1 million employer establishments accounted for retail sales of nearly $2.5 trillion.

<h4>CONTENT</h4>

Basic data obtained for all establishments include kind of business, geographic location, dollar volume of sales, annual and first quarter payroll, and employment for the pay period including March 12. Establishments receiving a census form provide additional data on sales by merchandise line and industry-specific measures, such as number of prescriptions sold by drug stores.

<h4>FREQUENCY</h4>

Every 5 years since 1972, for years ending in ""2"" and ""7."" From 1929 through 1967, retail trade statistics were published periodically as part of the census of business. Data collection begins in December of the census year and responses are due back in about 8 weeks. Data are requested for activities taking place during the census calendar year.

<h4>METHODS</h4>

A mail-out/mail-back data collection for establishments of multi-unit companies, large single-unit employers, and a sample of small employers; and administrative records data for non-selected small employers and all nonemployers. All establishments of multi-unit firms and single-unit employers with annualized payroll above a size cutoff receive a census form. A sample of small employers also receives a census form. This sample is selected using a stratified sampling procedure with strata based on industry and geography. Basic data for non-selected small employers are obtained from Federal administrative records. Estimates for sales by merchandise line and other industry-specific data are based partly on small employer sample results.


<h4>SCOPE </h4>

The Retail Trade sector (sector 44-45) comprises establishments engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. This sector comprises two main types of retailers: store and nonstore retailers. Store retailers operate fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. They typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients. In addition to retailing merchandise, some types of store retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified here. Nonstore retailers, like store retailers, are organized to serve the general public, but their retailing methods differ. The establishments of this subsector reach customers and market merchandise with methods such as the broadcasting of   infomercials,   the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale (nonstore) of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are classified here. Excluded from this sector are governmental organizations classified in the covered industries except for liquor stores operated by state and local governments. Data for direct sellers with no paid employees and post exchanges, ship stores, and similar establishments operated on military posts by agencies of the Federal Government are not included. The basic tabulations in this report do not include data for establishments which are auxiliary (primary function is providing a service, such as warehouses) to retail establishments within the same organization.

or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers
or retailers), (b) capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw
and intermediate materials and supplies used in production. 

Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate
from a warehouse or office. These warehouses and offices are
characterized by having little or no display of merchandise. In
addition, neither the design nor the location of the premises is
intended to solicit walk-in traffic. Wholesalers do not normally use
advertising directed to the general public. Customers are generally
reached initially via telephone, in-person marketing, or by specialized
advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.
Follow-up orders are either vendor-initiated or client-initiated,
generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties
between sellers and buyers. In fact, transactions are often conducted
between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing business
relationships. 

This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: those that sell
goods on their own account and those that arrange sales and purchases
for others for a commission or fee. 

(1) Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as
wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, drop shippers,
import/export merchants, and sales branches. These establishments
typically maintain their own warehouse, where they receive and handle
goods for their customers. Goods are generally sold without
transformation, but may include integral functions, such as sorting,
packaging, labeling, and other marketing services. 

(2) Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by
others or purchasing goods on a commission basis are known as agents
and brokers, commission merchants, import/export agents and brokers,
auction companies, and manufacturers' representatives. These
establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle
the goods they sell. 

Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single
manufacturer and promote and sell the particular manufacturers'
products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers. Other
wholesalers may be connected to a retail chain or a limited number of
retail chains and only provide a variety of products needed by that
particular retail operation(s). These wholesalers may obtain the
products from a wide range of manufacturers. Still other wholesalers
may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a
commission. 

Although, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large
volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be sold in single units. Sales
of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods
and services, such as farm machinery, medium and heavy duty trucks, and
industrial machinery, are always included in wholesale trade.

<p>
Sampling error is the difference between the estimate and the result that would be obtained from a complete enumeration of the population conducted under the same survey conditions. This error occurs because only a subset of the entire population is measured in a sample survey. Standard errors and coefficients of variation are estimated measures of sampling variation.
<p>
The margin of error used gives a range about the estimate, which is a 90 percent confidence interval. Confidence intervals are computed based on the particular sample selected and canvassed. If one repeats the process of drawing all possible samples and forming all corresponding confidence intervals, approximately 90 percent of these individual confidence intervals would contain the estimate computed from a complete enumeration of all units on the sampling frame. If the confidence interval includes 0, there is insufficient evidence to conclude at the 90 percent confidence level that the change is different from zero.
<p>
Nonsampling error encompasses all other factors that contribute to the total error of a sample survey estimate. This type of error can occur because of nonresponse, insufficient coverage of the universe of retail businesses with e-commerce sales, mistakes in the recording and coding of data, and other errors of collection, response, coverage, or processing. Although not directly measured, precautionary steps are taken to minimize the effects of nonsampling error.

In addition, tabulations and research on e-commerce data is done directly from the sample companies reporting in the MRTS.

activities are identified: raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities.  Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans
and/or purchasing securities. Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale and risk. This activity is known as financial intermediation. 

Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments. Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment. 

Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.

Linking was accomplished through probabilistic matching of establishment name and address.  Covers the United States and all industries that were in-scope for the 1992 and 2002 Economic Censuses.  It is one of the largest and most comprehensive of the linked employer-employee datasets created at CES.,"For a very complete discussion of what the 1990 DEED is and how it was constructed, see the CES working paper about the data by Bayard et al (CES WP #02-23).  This section will briefly summarize how the 1990 DEED was constructed and the characteristics of the resulting data.

The 1990 DEED was constructed by linking workers to establishments using establishment name and address.  The data on workers comes from the long-form sample of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing.   The 1990 long-form data provides detailed information on individuals for a 1-in-6 sample of households, covering topics such as age, education, characteristics of housing units, employment status, place-of-work geography, etc.  See the listing in this data information system for the 1990CEN files for a more complete discussion of this data.  The 1990 Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) contains data for establishments in the US and includes information on industry, employment, and payroll.  See the listing in this data information system for the SSL files for more information about this data.

By using a probabilistic matching software, workers from the 1990 Census were linked to establishments in the 1990 SSEL.  Of the workers from the 1990 Census that were available for matching, 22% were successfully linked to establishments.  Unlike prior datasets constructed at CES that linked these two datasets, all in-scope industries are represented in the data.  The data appears to be quite representative of the source data sets, both from the worker side and the establishment side.  Stringent match criteria was used to avoid false matches.

The 1990 DEED is the third in a series of data sets created at CES linking workers from the 1990 Decennial Census to establishments from the 1990 SSEL.  The Worker Establishment Characteristics Database (WECD) is restricted to only manufacturing establishments.  The New Worker Establishment Characteristics Database (NWECD) covers a broader set of industries but is similar to the WECD in that only establishments that are in unique industry-location cells are available for linking.  This means that urban areas and agglomerated industries are poorly represented in the WECD and NWECD.  By using name and address matching, the 1990 DEED overcomes those problems.  For most research needs, the 1990 DEED is a better choice than the WECD or NWECD.
","While great care was taken to get valid matches, not all the matches in the data are correct.  This is because the matching was automated and some of the address information used to link the datasets was incomplete.  In the CES working paper referenced above, there is a discussion of which industries are especially error ridden.  Generally, industries populated by establishments that are a member of a chain where establishments in the chain are located near each other are the most likely to have false matches.  For the vast majority of establishments, not all of the workers at the establishment were matched.  This because the source data is approximately a 1-in-6 sample of the working population in 1990 and some workers provide incomplete place-of-work address information.  The establishments in the 1990 DEED have higher than average employment because the probability that an establishment has a worker who can be matched in the 1990 Census long-form data rises with its number of employees.",n,108,108

","The Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities (CUT) includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, warehousing and
storage for goods, scenic and sightseeing transportation, and support
activities related to modes of transportation. Establishments in these
industries use transportation equipment or transportation related
facilities as a productive asset. The type of equipment depends on the
mode of transportation. The modes of transportation are air, rail,
water, road, and pipeline. 

The Transportation and Warehousing component distinguishes three basic
types of activities: mode of transportation, warehousing and storage, and providing support activities for transportation. In addition, there are establishments that provide passenger transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services.  Many of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and equipment spread over an extensive geographic area. Warehousing  stablishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse establishments do not sell the goods.

Industries in the Broadcasting and Telecommunications include
establishments providing point-to-point communications and the services
related to that activity. The industry groups (Radio and Television
Broadcasting, Cable Networks and Program Distribution, and
Telecommunications) are based on differences in the methods of
communication and in the nature of services provided. The Radio and
Television Broadcasting industry group includes establishments that
operate broadcasting studios and facilities for over the air or
satellite delivery of radio and television programs of entertainment,
news, talk, and the like. These establishments are often engaged in the
production and purchase of programs and generating revenues from the
sale of air time to advertisers and from donations, subsidies, and/or
the sale of programs. The Cable Networks and Program Distribution
industry group includes two types of establishments. Those in the Cable
Networks industry operate studios and facilities for the broadcasting
of programs that are typically narrowcast in nature (limited format,
such as news, sports, education, and youth-oriented programming). The
services of these establishments are typically sold on a subscription
or fee basis. Delivery of the programs to customers is handled by other
establishments, in the Cable and Other Program Distribution industry,
that operate cable systems, direct-to-home satellite systems, or other
similar systems. The Telecommunications industry group is primarily
engaged in operating, maintaining, and/or providing access to
facilities for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and full
motion picture video between network termination points. A transmission
facility may be based on a single technology or a combination of
technologies. 

The Utilities component comprises establishments engaged in the
provision of the following utility services: electric power, natural
gas, steam supply, water supply, and sewage removal. Within this
sector, the specific activities associated with the utility services
provided vary by utility: electric power includes generation,
transmission, and distribution; natural gas includes distribution;
steam supply includes provision and/or distribution; water supply
includes treatment and distribution; and sewage removal includes
collection, treatment, and disposal of waste through sewer systems and
sewage treatment facilities.",,y,107,107

The series is useful for studying the economic activity of small businesses at various geographic levels.  Most types of businesses covered by the Census Bureau economic statistics programs are included in the nonemployer statistics. Tax-exempt businesses are excluded. All of the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting sector, except crop and animal production, are covered in nonemployer statistics; these industries typically are not covered in other Census Bureau economic programs. Nonemployer businesses are generally small, such as real estate agents and independent contractors.

  Nonemployer statistics have been released every 5 years since 1972, for years ending in 2 and 7 for selected industries in conjunction with economic census publications.  Nonemployer statistics data originate chiefly from administrative records of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Data are primarily comprised of sole proprietorship businesses filing IRS Form 1040, Schedule C, although a small percentage of the data is derived from filers of partnership and corporation tax returns that report no paid employees.

employers, small employers, and non-employers.  Respondents are asked to
provide capital expenditures data for each industry in which they had
activity and to classify these expenditures as new or used and as
structures, equipment, or other.  Industry detail is at the 2- to 3-digit
SIC level (3- to 4-digit NAICS level, in more recent years).  Additional
firm-level information on total assets, depreciation & retirements,
sales/revenue, capital lease arrangements, and capitalized interest is also
requested.  In certain years, firms are asked to break down their
expenditures further, by type of structure (in 1992, 1994, and 1998) and
type of equipment (in 1992 and 1998).  CES has ACES microdata for reference
years 1993 to the present.  Additionally, expense data is available from the Information & Communication Technology  (ICT) Survey for 2003.","The Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES) is a firm-level survey
designed to collect industry-level data on capital investment in new and
used structures and equipment.  In certain years, additional detail on
expenditure by asset type (by industry) is collected.  All non-farm sectors
of the economy are covered by the survey.

From 1993-1995, the ACES sample consisted of 27,000-30,000 companies with 5
or more employees.  In 1993 and 1995, an abbreviated survey form (ACE-2)
was sent to 15,000 companies with under 5 employees or no employees
(non-employers).  Since 1996, the sample has consisted of roughly
32,000-44,000 companies with employees and 12,000-15,000 companies with no
employees (who received an abbreviated survey form).

Firms are asked to provide capital expenditures data for each industry in
which they had activity and to classify these expenditures as new or used
and as structures, equipment, or other.  Respondents were also asked to
report new structures and equipment acquired under capital lease agreements
entered into during the survey year, and capitalized interest incurred to
produce or construct new fixed assets during the survey year.  In addition,
certain data on total assets, depreciation & retirements, and sales/revenue
are also collected.

Prior to 1999, capital expenditure data was collected on almost 100
industries at the two- to three-digit SIC level of detail (exhausting the
non-farm sectors of the economy).  Since 1999, data are collected on about
134 non-farm industries at the three- to four-digit NAICS level of detail.
In addition, a category was provided for classifying a firm's structures
and equipment expenditures serving multiple industries; for example,
headquarters, regional offices, and central research laboratories.

In certain years of the ACES, firms are asked to break down their
investment expenditures by type of structure and by type of equipment (in
addition to breaking it down by industry). For example, in 1994, firms were
asked to provide detail on their structure expenditure.  In 1998, detail on
both structure and equipment expenditure was asked.  The ACES recognizes
approximately 29 different categories of structure expenditure and 26
different categories of equipment expenditure.

CES has ACES microdata from reference years 1993 to the present.  Additionally, expense data is available from the Information & Communication Technology  (ICT) Survey for 2003. Data are typically released 15-17 months after the end of the reference year.  We do not currently have the data from the test surveys of 1991 and 1992.

The establishment identification system for the BR is the same as for all other Census Bureau business data but differs from the LEHD establishment identifier.  There is no one best way to form linkages between these data sources.  There are many alternatives, and the optimal linking strategy depends on the research objective.

The firm or SEIN level file contains one record for every YEAR QUARTER a firm is present on either the ES-202 or the UI, with more detailed information available for the establishments of multi-unit firms in the SEIN SEINUNIT file.  The SEIN file is built up from the SEINUNIT file and contains no additional information.  It should be viewed merely as an easier and more efficient way to access firm level data.","The primary data source for the Employer Characteristics File (ECF) are the ES-
202 files. The ES-202 files contain information at both the firm and establishment level and the ECF continues this structure, but the ”master” records are removed and the firm level information is appended to the establishment data. The next major source of data comes from the UI/EHF. Person level job information is aggregated to the firm level and is merged with the ES-202 information. The union of these two data sources determines the set of records on the ECF. The ES-202 data contains among other variables, information on establishment location, Federal EIN, and industry. Any missing establishment characteristics are filled with information from the closest quarter, the firm level mode, and eventually imputed, if no firm specific information is available. The UI/EHF and the ES-202 both contribute information on payroll and
employment. Various algorithms are used to combine this information in the most sensible way possible.  Finally, the address information available on the ES-202 is processed through an address standardization and Geographic Information System (GIS) processing system to create the Geocoded Address List (GAL).  The resulting establishment level geocode information from the GAL is then merged back onto the ECF.","The quality of the ECF depends primarily on the quality of the incoming UI and ES-202 data as received from the state. The quality of the data is generally high for 2000 and beyond, but earlier years’ historical data files may be incomplete. Although the data undergoes various quality control checks and
imputations of missing values once received at LEHD, in some cases this is only a partial solution. States, also vary in the quality of the establishment level data reported for multi-unit firms. The lack of consistent reporting of establishment level information can greatly affect the geographic dispersion of employment and payroll. In both 1992 and 1997 efforts were made to expand the collection of establishment level data.  Expansions in the number of establishments in those years are likely not related to new economic activity,
but reflect improved collection activities.",y,163,163

A second sample of about 5,500 establishmenst (including 900 that participated in the first survey, and an oversample of states involved in particular education reforms) was surveyed in 1997 and 1998. The National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce (EQW), a nonprofit research group, fully funded the survey.","The NES collected data on four topics: employees and employment, employee training, business characteristics, and equipment and technology. Employees and employment included number of employees, work week, pay, benefits, supervision, hiring practices and union representation. Employee training included organization, purposes, formal and informal programs, duration, trainees and effectiveness. Business characteristics included year operations began, company and establishment size, principal product and exports. Equipment and technology included capital assets, recent investments, age of equipment, use of computers and research activities.

The first survey primarily collected information on establishment performance in 1993. Some information was also collected for earlier years.  Questions regarding work practices refer to the time of the survey.  Data collection began in August 1994 and continued for about 8 weeks; a follow-up, conducted in 1996, collected information about 1995. 

Data were collected using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey of 3,100 establishments, supplemented by historical census and survey performance (productivity) measures for most manufacturing establishments. A stratified random sample of establishments with 20 or more employees was randomly selected from the Census Bureau's Business Register (BR), with strata defined by business size and type of activity. The sample was evenly divided between manufacturers and nonmanufacturers, with explicit oversampling within industry strata of establishments that had 100 or more employees.  Historical performance measures for manufacturing establishments were obtained from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Respondents received an introductory letter describing the survey but, because this was a telephone survey, no printed form.

The survey was repeated in August 1997 (the NES II).  The NES II sample had three components.  The first used the same sample design as the first NES (except that it did not cover the states mentionned below), and had about 2,500 establishments.  The second component was a sample of about 2,000 additional establishments in states involved in particular educational reform programs (California, Kentucky, Michigan, Maryland, and Pennsylvania) to ensure larger-than-representative samples in those states.

Beginning in 2009 the ACS also combines data collected over the preceding five years to provide aggregate data to the public for small areas less than 20,000 with accuracy similar to the decennial census. The restricted access microdata files have also been combined in multi-year files, with a few modifications to the data to produce a unified file: First, the weights have been recalculated so that they roll up to the national total in the most recent year in the dataset.  Second, all geography has been reconciled to be consistent with the most recent year. Third, dollar values have been adjusted for inflation.  Fourth, in those cases where a question has changed, the multi-year data reflects a ""lowest common denominator"" version of that variable, so, for example, if valid responses to a survey question were changed from continuous to categorical, the continuous responses from earlier years would be changed to valid categorical values.  Fifth, only those questions asked in all years will be included in the multi-year data files.  That is, if a question is added to the survey or dropped from the survey during the five-year period, that variable will not be included in the five-year data file.

Proposals will be accepted by CES beginning July 1, 2007 to use AHRQ data sets. AHRQ has specified a proposal format on their data center website and will handle all proposal review and also disclosure avoidance review for their data; they have agreed to waive their fee for creating the researcher's data extract for RDC researchers. Standard Census RDC access charges, if any, will apply. Proposals to use their data at any site other than their headquarters site in Rockville MD will be submitted through the standard Census RDC proposal process, but will not have to meet Census Bureau standards, just AHRQ standards (see their website). (Proposals to use confidential data from both the Census Bureau and the AHRQ must use the existing Census Bureau application procedure, and will also be reviewed by AHRQ, and the Internal Revenue Service if tax data is involved.)

All researchers will need to become Special Sworn Status (SSS) employees of the Census Bureau -- in case of incidental access to confidential Census Bureau or Internal Revenue Service data while in an RDC -- and will also be required to become National Center for Health Statistics agents (as AHRQ data is based on the National Health Interview Survey), and take the appropriate training for both roles.

Researchers currently using the Rockville AHRQ data center will be able to transfer their research to a Census RDC site once they become SSS employees. Contact the appropriate Census RDC Administrator for more information on the SSS process.

The LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) provides researchers with the tool to make this linkage. The primary bridge between the LEHD data and the business data is the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual Business Register (BR), a list of establishments the Bureau uses to develop the initial mailing list for the economic censuses and surveys. The BR contains data from several different sources. Primarily, however, the BR contains very reliable information on business identifiers, business organizational structure, and business location. All of this detail helps us to form links to the LEHD data. Unfortunately, we are not able to directly form establishment-to-establishment linkages between LEHD data and the Business Register. The establishment identification system for the BR is the same as for all other Census Bureau business data products but different from the LEHD establishment identifier. Unfortunately, there is no one best way to form linkages between these data sources. There are many alternatives, and the optimal linking strategy depends on the research objective. To provide researchers with as much flexibility as possible, the BRB has been constructed as a crosswalk that allows for a number of different ways to integrate these data sources.","The Business Register and the EHF/ECF represent two different attempts to build a universe of active firms.

available for the establishments of multi-unit firms in the SEIN SEINUNIT file. The SEIN file is built up from the SEINUNIT file and contains no additional information, but should be viewed merely as an easier and/or more efficient way to access firm level data.","The primary data source for the Employer Characteristics File (ECF) are the ES-
202 files. The ES-202 files contain information at both the firm and establishment level and the ECF continues this structure, but the ”master” records are removed and the firm level information is appended to the establishment data. The next major source of data comes from the UI/EHF. Person level job information is aggregated to the firm level and is merged with the ES-202 information. The union of these two data sources determines the set of records on the ECF. The ES-202 data contains among other variables, information on establishment location, Federal EIN, and industry. Any missing establishment characteristics are filled with information from the closest quarter, the firm level mode, and eventually imputed, if no firm specific information is available. The UI/EHF and the ES-202 both contribute information on payroll and
employment. Various algorithms are used to combine this information in the most sensible way possible. Finally, the address information available on the ES-202 is processed through an address standardization and Geographic Information System (GIS) processing system to create the Geocoded Address List (GAL). The resulting establishment level geocode information from the GAL is then merged back onto the ECF.","The quality of the ECF depends primarily on the quality of the incoming UI and ES-202 data as received from the state.

The ILBD was developed with support of the Census Bureau and the Kauffman Foundation.","Constructing an Integrated Longitudinal Business Database

A.  Overview of Main Tasks and Previous Work

In terms of data development, our objective is to build a fully Integrated Longitudinal Business-level Database (ILBD) that covers all employer and nonemployer business units in the nonfarm private U.S. economy. We construct the initial version of the ILBD for the years 1992 and 1994-2000, and we plan updates for later years in future enhancements of the ILBD.  Key data on nonemployers are unavailable for 1993. 

From an analytical perspective, the presence or absence of employees is simply another business characteristic to be measured. From a database development perspective, however, integrating the Census Bureau’s employer and nonemployer business universes is a major undertaking.  The main tasks fall into three categories.  One task is to integrate the employer and nonemployer universes on a year-by-year basis, ensuring that each unique business entity is counted once, and only once.  A second task is to construct longitudinal links for business units within each universe.  A third task is to construct contemporaneous and dynamic ownership links across universes between employer and nonemployer business units.  To carry out these tasks, we build on previous work by Jarmin and Miranda (2003) to create the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which contains annual data from 1975 to 2001 for all nonfarm private employers. We also build on previous efforts to construct longitudinal links within the nonemployer universe by Nucci and Boden (2003) and Boden and Nucci (2004). 

B.  Source Data for the ILBD

Census Bureau business registers draw on payroll tax records, corporate and individual income tax returns, applications for an Employer Identification Number (EIN), and various Census Bureau business surveys.  The data available to the Census Bureau depend on the legal and tax status of a business and, in certain respects, on the size of the business and the number of its locations. For large corporations, routine data inputs include payroll records and particular items from corporate income tax returns, augmented by direct Census Bureau collections for multi-location companies. For sole proprietors, partnerships and single-location corporations with employees, routine data inputs include payroll records, certain items from income tax returns and periodic Census Bureau surveys such as the quinquennial Economic Census.  For nonemployer businesses, routine data inputs derive mainly from income tax returns. 
   
Linking records from different sources requires common business identifiers.  Businesses with employees have unique Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and other Census Bureau identifiers.  Some nonemployer businesses also have an EIN, but most do not and instead are tracked by the person ID of the business owner, i.e., his or her Protected Identification Key (PIK) (the PIK is a Census Bureau analog to the SSN). 

To construct the ILBD, we must first ensure that administrative data from each universe are cleaned and ready for integration.  On the employer side, this task has been largely accomplished in the work to create the LBD. The LBD contains high-quality longitudinal links for establishments, and for the most part it is easy to accurately determine establishment age.  Longitudinal establishment links are relatively straightforward to construct, because they are one to one, and because establishments typically have well-defined physical locations.  Firms are more difficult to track over time, partly because firm-level links can be many to many.  Work is underway at the Census Bureau to develop a rich set of longitudinal firm linkages.  In the meantime, we define the age of a firm in the LBD as the age of its oldest establishment.

Longitudinal links are difficult to construct in the nonemployer universe for some of the same reasons that they are difficult to construct for firms in the employer universe.  For example, when there is a change in the legal or tax status of a nonemployer business, its EIN or person ID can also change. (Person IDs do not change for individuals, but ownership changes can yield a change in the person ID associated with a business.)  In these instances, it is not straightforward to maintain longitudinal links for nonemployer businesses using data items that are routinely included in the Census Bureau’s administrative records systems. On the employer side, direct Census Bureau collections provide this additional information, but there is no ready equivalent on the nonemployer side. Hence, in the face of changes in legal and tax status, longitudinal links for nonemployers require matching algorithms based on data items such as business name, location and industry.

Linking records across the employer and nonemployer business universes is further complicated by differences in the underlying administrative data and differences in the unit of analysis.  The Census Bureau’s Employer Business Register, which underlies the LBD, is a list of establishments (physical locations) maintained to serve as a mailing list for the Economic Census and as a frame for a variety of surveys. It relies heavily on administrative data and is augmented by direct Census Bureau collections.  Longitudinal linking is facilitated by establishment IDs (LBD Numbers and Permanent Plant Numbers or PPNs), EINs, enterprise IDs (Alphas), and business name and address information.  In contrast, the Census Bureau’s Nonemployer Business Register consists entirely of administrative data.  The unit of analysis is a business entity, as recorded on a tax return.  Our longitudinal links for nonemployer businesses currently exploit EINs, person IDs in the form of PIKs, business name information, and geographic information.  One complication arises when an individual taxpayer reports income for multiple nonemployer businesses. For example, multiple Schedule C forms can be attached to a single 1040 tax form. We deal with these cases by aggregating to the level of a single tax filing, which is associated with a unique person ID or EIN.  We then create longitudinal links across years using these numeric identifiers and business name.  We describe our procedure for linking records across the business universes below. 

C.	The Matching Algorithm

[Note: This section describes the matching algorithm used to construct a prototype ILBD.  It utilizes both matches based on common numeric identifiers (e.g., EINs) and character based information such as business name and address.  The vast majority of all linkages (both longitidinal links within the nonemployer universe and links across the nonemployer and employer universes) where based on numeric linkages.  Due to time and other constraints, the first version of the ILBD to be deployed to the RDCs is based on numeric linkages only.  Subsequent versions will incorporate name and address linkages as well.]

In addition to the longitudinal links within each universe, we created a set of links between the employer and nonemployer universes for our selected industries.  These links make use of numeric identifiers, business names, and other data items found on records in both universes. The numeric identifier for most nonemployer businesses is the owner’s PIK.  We have several numeric identifiers available in the Employer Business Register and from the LBD.  The most useful for our purposes is the EIN, but many records in the Employer Business Register contain both an EIN and a PIK.  For example, when a business owner applies for an EIN, he or she must fill out an SS-4 form for the IRS.  This form includes the business name, the PIK of the business owner or chief officer and the EIN, all of which are included in the administrative records system in the Census Bureau business registers.  

We take a conservative approach in matching records across the nonemployer and employer universes.  In particular, we rely only on the EIN and PIK numeric identifiers and business name. Previous efforts to develop longitudinal identifiers for the LBD have shown that linkages can be significantly improved by the use of more sophisticated probabilistic matching algorithms that exploit all of the relevant available information, and that take into account the reliability of the information.  We plan to incorporate some of these techniques in future enhancements of the ILBD.  For now, given the conservative nature of our algorithm, we understate the incidence of linkages between the two universes.  For the same reason, we also understate the contribution of nonemployer businesses to the formation of employer businesses. 

Since multiple establishments can have the same numeric and name identifiers, it is important to “unduplicate” the files by year and identifier before proceeding to match them to the nonemployer universe by EIN, PIK or name.  In the employer universe, the most common form of duplication arises when a multi-location company operates many establishments under one EIN or business name.  We perform the match using a file that contains only one record per unique value of the linking variables.  We are most confident about cross-universe matches based on numeric identifiers.  Therefore, we search for matches based on EIN, PIK and business name in that order. We experimented with a number of name-matching procedures, including the removal of vowels, various symbols, and commonly used abbreviations (“inc.”, “ltd”, etc.).  However, after examining a sample of matches, we concluded that literal name strings produced highly reliable matches and appeared to miss very few “good” matches.

COMPOSITION OF INDUSTRY CATEGORIES
There are 89 separately tabulated industry categories in the M3 survey. These categories are groupings of the 473 manufacturing industries as defined in the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Manual. Chapter B lists these categories. Because companies provide data on a voluntary basis, reporting in many of these 89 categories is not sufficient to warrant separate publication of the data. Consolidated reporting by some large companies also limits the quality of the data in some categories. A company that reports on a
consolidated basis (entire company or a division) is included in the M3 category in which the reporting unit as a whole is classified and has no influence on the movement of the other industries which may be included in its combined report.
As a result, it has been necessary to combine the 89 industry categories into 59 publication levels for shipments and total inventories. For new and unfilled orders and inventories by stage of fabrication, it has been necessary to introduce further combinations because of the lower response rates for those items.

COMPOSITION OF THE SURVEY PANEL
The monthly M3 estimates are based on information obtained from most manufacturing companies with $500 million or more in annual shipments. In order to strengthen the sample coverage in individual industry categories, the survey includes selected smaller companies. The sources from which companies are identified for inclusion in the survey panel are the quinquennial economic censuses, manufacturing sector, and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM).
For firms that operate in a single M3 industry category, the reporting unit typically comprises all operations of the company. Most large, diversified companies, however, file separate reports for divisions with significant activity in different industrial areas. The composition of each company or reporting unit of a company in the survey usually includes more than one plant or establishment and frequently includes industry activities outside the M3
category in which it is classified. The survey methodology described later in this chapter assumes that the month-to-month changes of the total operations of the reporting units classified in each industry category effectively represent the month-to-month movements of all establishments that make up the category.
In 1962, the initially selected sample for this survey included all companies with more than 1,000 employees and smaller companies selected with probabilities proportional to their employment size within each industry category. As there was some deterioration in response rates for companies with between 100 and 1,000 employees, in January 1975, the staff selected a supplemental sample of approximately 1,000 companies from the universe of companies in this size range in order to strengthen the estimates. Although the response rate was only about 60 percent for this...","The monthly data presented in this publication are subject to both sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because reports are received from a sample rather than from the complete universe of manufacturing companies. Because the present composition of the panel is not based on a probability sample, the amount of sampling error cannot be quantified. Nonsampling errors, on the other hand, are attributable to many sources. The use of company or divisional reports to estimate the monthly change for establishments is one source of nonsampling error. The use primarily of large companies to represent the month-to-month movement of all companies is another potential source. In addition, response and processing errors may be present, although computer edits and analytical review of the data detect the most significant errors of this kind prior to tabulation.",y,204,204

The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Service Annual Survey (SAS) to provide national estimates of annual revenues and expenses of establishments classified in select service sectors.

We develop the estimates in this report using data from a probability sample and administrative data. Survey questionnaires are mailed to a probability sample that is regularly updated and periodically re-selected from a universe of firms located in the United States and having paid employees. The sample includes firms of all sizes and covers both taxable firms and firms exempt from Federal income taxes. Firms without paid employees (nonemployers) are included in the estimates through administrative data provided by other Federal agencies and through imputation.

Coverage
The estimates contained in this report are summarized by industry classification based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The NAICS groups establishments into industries based on the activities in which they are primarily engaged. This system, developed jointly by the statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, allows for comparisons of business activity across North America.

SAMPLE DESIGN AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURES
A new sample was introduced with the 2005 Service Annual Survey (SAS). The new sample was designed to produce estimates based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This section describes the design, selection, and estimation procedures for the new sample. For descriptions of prior samples, see the Service Annual Survey publications.

Sampling Frame
The sampling frame used for the Service Annual Survey (SAS) has two types of sampling units represented: Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and large, multiple-establishment firms. Both sampling units represent clusters of one or more establishments owned or controlled by the same firm. The information used to create these sampling units was extracted from data collected as part of the 2002 Economic Census and from establishment records contained on the Census Bureau's Business Register as updated to December 2004. The next few paragraphs give details about the Business Register; the distinction between firms, EINs, and establishments; and the construction of the sampling units. Though important, they are not essential to understanding the basic sample design and readers may continue to the Stratification, Sampling Rates, and Allocation section.

The Business Register is a multi-relational database that contains a record for each known establishment that is located in the United States or one of its territories and has paid employees. An establishment is a single physical location where business transactions take place and for which payroll and employment records are kept. Groups of one or more establishments under common ownership or control are firms. A single-unit firm owns or operates only one establishment. A multiunit firm owns or operates two or more establishments. The treatment of establishments on the Business Register differs according to whether the establishment is part of a single-unit or multiunit firm. In particular, the structure of an establishment’s primary identifier on the Business Register differs depending on whether it is owned by a single-unit firm or by a multiunit firm.

A single-unit firm’s primary identifier is its EIN. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues the EIN, and the firm uses it as an identifier to report social security payments for its employees under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). The same act requires all employer firms to use EINs. Each employer firm is associated with at least one EIN and only one firm can use a given EIN. Because a single-unit firm has only one establishment, there is a one-to-one relationship between the firm and the EIN. Thus the firm, the EIN, and the establishment all reference the same physical location and all three terms can be used interchangeably and unambiguously when referring to a single-unit firm.

For multiunit firms however, a different structure connects the firm with its establishments via the EIN. Essentially a multiunit firm is associated with a cluster of one or more EINs and EINs are associated with one or more establishments. A multiunit firm consists of at least two establishments. Each firm is associated with at least one EIN and only one firm can use a given EIN. However, one multiunit firm may have several EINs. Similarly, there is a one-to-many relationship between EINs and establishments. Each EIN can be associated with many establishments but each establishment is associated with only one EIN. Because of the possibility of one-to-many relationships, we must distinguish between the firm, its EINs, and its establishments. The multiunit firm that owns or controls a particular establishment is identified on the Business Register by way of the establishment’s primary identifier.

The primary identifier of an establishment owned by a multiunit firm consists of a unique combination of an alpha number and a plant number. The alpha number identifies the multiunit firm, and the plant number identifies a particular establishment within that firm. All establishments owned or controlled by the same multiunit firm have the same alpha number. Different multiunit firms have different alpha numbers, and different establishments within the same multiunit firm have different plant numbers. The Census Bureau assigns both the alpha number to the multiunit firm and plant numbers to the corresponding establishments based on the results of the quinquennial economic census and the annual Company Organization Survey.

To create the sampling frame, we extract the records for all establishments located in the United States and classified in select service sectors as defined by the 2002 NAICS. For these establishments, we extract revenue, payroll, employment, name and address information, as well as primary identifiers and, for establishments owned by multiunit firms, associated EINs.

To create the sampling units for multiunit firms, we aggregate the economic data of the establishments owned by these firms to an EIN level by tabulating the establishment data for all service establishments associated with the same EIN. Similarly we aggregate the data to a multiunit firm level by tabulating the establishment data for all service establishments associated with the same alpha number. No aggregation is necessary to put single-unit establishment information on an EIN basis or a firm basis. Thus, the sampling units created for single-unit firms simultaneously represent establishment, EIN, and firm information. In summary, the sampling frame is a complex amalgam of establishments, EINs, and firms.

Stratification, Sampling Rates, and Allocation
The primary stratification of the sampling frame is by industry group based on the detail required for publication. We further stratify the sampling units within industry group by a measure of size (substratify) related to their annual revenue. Sampling units expected to have a large effect on the precision of the estimates are selected “with certainty.” This means they are sure to be selected and will represent only themselves (i.e., have a selection probability of 1 and a sampling weight of 1). Within each industry stratum, we determine a substratum boundary (or cutoff) that divides the certainty units from the noncertainty units. We base these cutoffs on a statistical analysis of data from the 2002 Economic Census. Accordingly, these values are on a 2002 revenue basis. We also used this analysis to determine the number of size substrata for each industry stratum and to set preliminary sampling rates needed to achieve specified sampling variability constraints on revenue estimates for different industry groups. The size substrata and sampling rates are later updated through analysis of the sampling frame.

Sample Selection
The first step in the sample selection identified firms selected with certainty: the estimated annual revenue of the firm was greater than the corresponding certainty cutoff.

All firms not selected with certainty were subjected to sampling on an EIN basis. If a firm had more than one EIN, we treated each of its EINs as a separate sampling unit. To be eligible for the initial sampling, an EIN had to have nonzero payroll in 2003. The EINs were stratified according to their major industry and their estimated revenue (on a 2002 basis). Within each noncertainty stratum, a simple random sample of EINs was selected without replacement.

Sample Maintenance
Periodically, we update the sample to represent new EINs appearing on the Business Register. These new EINs, called births, are EINs recently assigned by the IRS on the latest available IRS mailing list for FICA taxpayers and assigned an industry classification (if possible) by the Social Security Administration (SSA).

The EIN births are sampled on a quarterly basis using a two-phase selection procedure. To be eligible for selection, a birth must either have no industry classification or be classified in an industry within the scope of SAS, the Annual Wholesale Trade Survey (AWTS), or the Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS), and it must meet certain criteria regarding its number of paid employees or quarterly payroll. In the first phase, births are stratified by broad industry groups and a measure of size based on quarterly payroll. A relatively large sample is selected using equal probability systematic sampling. The selected births are canvassed to obtain a more reliable measure of size, consisting of sales in 2 recent months, company affiliation information, and a new or more detailed industry classification code. Births that haven’t returned their questionnaire after 30 days are contacted by telephone.

Using this more reliable information, the selected births from the first phase are subjected to probability proportional-to-size sampling with overall probabilities equivalent to those used in drawing the initial SAS, AWTS, and ARTS samples from the December 2004 Business Register. Because of the time it takes for a new employer firm to acquire an EIN from the IRS, and because of the time needed to accomplish the two-phase birth-selection procedure, births are added to the sample approximately 9 months after they begin operation.

The births that are selected in the quarterly birth-selection procedure in November of the survey year are included in the initial mailing of the SAS questionnaires in January of the following year. To better represent all EIN births in the reference year, and specifically to account for the time it takes to identify and select new EINs, we add births to the SAS sample that are selected in February, May, and August the year following the reference year. We mail survey forms to these births in June and August to supplement the initial survey mailing.

To be eligible for the sample canvass and tabulation, an EIN selected in the noncertainty sampling operations must meet both of the following requirements:

    * It must be on the latest available IRS mailing list for FICA taxpayers from the previous quarter.
    * It must have been selected from the Business Register in either the initial sampling or during the quarterly birth-selection procedure.

If a firm was selected with certainty and had more than one establishment at the time of sampling, any new establishments that the firm acquires, even if under new or different EINs, are included in the sample with certainty. However, if a single-unit firm was selected with certainty, only future establishments associated with that firm’s originally-selected EIN are included in the sample with certainty; any new EINs that might later be associated with that firm are subjected to sampling through the quarterly birth-selection procedure.
EINs selected into the sample with certainty are not dropped from canvass and tabulation if they are no longer on the IRS mailing list. Rather, the firm that used the EIN is contacted, and if a successor EIN is found, it is added to the survey. For both inactive and reactivated EINs, data are tabulated for only the portion of the reference year that these EINs reported payroll to the IRS.","The published estimates may differ from the actual, but unknown, population values. For a particular estimate, statisticians define this difference as the total error of the estimate. When describing the accuracy of survey results, it is convenient to discuss total error as the sum of sampling error and nonsampling error. Sampling error is the error arising from the use of a sample, rather than a census, to estimate population values. Nonsampling error encompasses all other factors that contribute to the total error of a sample survey estimate. Further descriptions of sampling error and nonsampling error are provided in the following sections. Data users should take into account the estimates of sampling error and the potential effects of nonsampling error when using the published estimates.

Sampling Error
Because the estimates are based on a sample, exact agreement with results that would be obtained from a complete enumeration of firms on the sampling frame using the same enumeration procedures is not expected. However, because each firm on the sampling frame has a known probability of being selected into the sample, it is possible to estimate the sampling variability of the survey estimates.

The particular sample used in this survey is one of a large number of samples of the same size that could have been selected using the same design. If all possible samples had been surveyed under the same conditions, an estimate of a population parameter of interest could have been obtained from each sample. For the parameter of interest, estimates derived from the different samples would, in general, differ from each other. Common measures of the variability among these estimates are the sampling variance, the standard error, and the coefficient of variation (CV). The sampling variance is defined as the squared difference, averaged over all possible samples of the same size and design, between the estimator and its average value. The standard error is the square root of the sampling variance. The CV expresses the standard error as a percentage of the estimate to which it refers. For example, an estimate of 200 units that has an estimated standard error of 10 units has an estimated CV of 5 percent. The sampling variance, standard error, and CV of an estimate can be estimated from the selected sample because the sample was selected using probability sampling. Note that measures of sampling variability, such as the standard error and CV, are estimated from the sample and are also subject to sampling variability. (Technically, we should refer to the estimated standard error or the estimated CV of an estimator. However, for the sake of brevity we have omitted this detail.) It is important to note that the standard error and CV only measure sampling variability. They do not measure any systematic biases in the estimates.

The Census Bureau recommends that individuals using published estimates incorporate this information into their analyses, as sampling error could affect the conclusions drawn from these estimates.

The estimate from a particular sample and its associated standard error can be used to construct a confidence interval. A confidence interval is a range about a given estimator that has a specified probability of containing the average of the estimates for the parameter derived from all possible samples of the same size and design. Associated with each interval is a percentage of confidence, which is interpreted as follows. If, for each possible sample, an estimate of a population parameter and its approximate standard error were obtained, then:

   1. For approximately 90 percent of the possible samples, the interval from 1.65 standard errors below to 1.65 standard errors above the estimate would include the average of the estimates derived from all possible samples of the same size and design.
   2. For approximately 95 percent of the possible samples, the interval from 1.96 standard errors below to 1.96 standard errors above the estimate would include the average of the estimates derived from all possible samples of the same size and design.

To illustrate the computation of a confidence interval for an estimate of total revenue, assume that an estimate of total revenue is $10,750 million and the CV for this estimate is 1.8 percent, or 0.018. First obtain the standard error of the estimate by multiplying the total revenue estimate by its CV. For this example, multiply $10,750 million by 0.018. This yields a standard error of $193.5 million. The upper and lower bounds of the 90-percent confidence interval are computed as $10,750 million plus or minus 1.645 times $193.5 million. Consequently, the 90-percent confidence interval is $10,432 million to $11,068 million. If corresponding confidence intervals were constructed for all possible samples of the same size and design, approximately 9 out of 10 (90 percent) of these intervals would contain the average of the estimates derived from all possible samples.

Nonsampling Errors
Nonsampling error encompasses all other factors, other than sampling error, that contribute to the total error of a sample survey estimate and may also occur in censuses. It is often helpful to think of nonsampling error as arising from deficiencies or mistakes in the survey process. Nonsampling errors are difficult to measure and can be attributed to many sources: the inclusion of erroneous units in the survey (overcoverage), the exclusion of eligible units from the survey (undercoverage), nonresponse, misreporting, mistakes in recording and coding responses, misinterpretation of questions, and other errors of collection, response, coverage, or processing. Although nonsampling error is not measured directly, the Census Bureau employs quality control procedures throughout the process to minimize this type of error.

A potential source of bias in the estimates is nonresponse. Nonresponse is defined as the inability to obtain all the intended measurements or responses about all selected units. Two types of nonresponse are often distinguished. Unit nonresponse is used to describe the inability to obtain any of the substantive measurements about a sampled unit. In most cases of unit nonresponse, the questionnaire was never returned to the Census Bureau after several attempts to elicit a response. Item nonresponse occurs either when a question is unanswered or the response to the question fails computer or analyst edits.

For both unit and item nonresponse, a missing value is replaced by a predicted value obtained from an appropriate model for nonresponse. This procedure is called imputation and uses survey data and administrative data as input. For SAS, imputed revenue amounts to about 9.3 percent of the total services revenue estimate. ",n,205,205

","The CIR program has been providing monthly, quarterly, and annual measures of industrial activity for many years. Since 1904, with its cotton and fats and oils surveys, the CIR program has formed an essential part of an integrated statistical system involving the quinquennial economic census, manufacturing sector, and the annual survey of manufactures.

The data are used to satisfy economic policy needs and for market analysis, forecasting, and decision making in the private sector. Individual firms, trade associations, and market analysts in planning or recommending marketing and legislative strategies use the product-level data generated by these surveys extensively, particularly if their industry is significantly affected by foreign trade. Although production and shipments information are the two most common data items collected, the CIR program collects other measures also such as inventories, orders, and consumption. These surveys measure manufacturing activity in important commodity areas such as textiles and apparel, chemicals, primary metals, computer and electronic components, industrial equipment, aerospace equipment, and consumer goods.

The CIR program uses a unified data collection, processing, and publication system. The U.S. Census Bureau updates the survey panels for most reports annually and reconciles the estimates to the results of the broader-based annual survey of manufactures and the economic census, manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector provides a complete list of all producers of the products covered by the CIR program and serves as the primary source for CIR sampling. Where a small number of producers exist, CIR surveys cover all known producers of a product. However, when the number of producers is too large, cutoff and random sampling techniques are used. Surveys are continually reviewed and modified to provide the most up-to-date information on products produced. The CIR program includes a group of mandatory and voluntary surveys. Typically the monthly and quarterly surveys are conducted on a voluntary basis. Those companies that choose not to respond to the voluntary surveys are required to submit a mandatory annual counterpart corresponding to the more frequent survey.","RELIABILITY OF DATA

Survey error may result from several sources including the inability to obtain information about all cases in the survey, response errors, definitional difficulties, differences in the interpretation of questions, mistakes in recording or coding the reported data, and other errors of collection, response, coverage, and estimation. These nonsampling errors also occur in complete censuses. Although no direct measurement of the biases due to these nonsampling errors has been obtained, precautionary steps were taken in all phases of the collection, processing, and tabulation of the data in an effort to minimize their influence.

A major source of bias in the published estimates is the imputing of data for nonrespondents, for late reporters, and for data that fail logic edits. Missing figures are imputed based on period-to-period movements shown by reporting firms. A figure is considered to be an impute if the value was not directly reported on the questionnaire, directly derived from other reported items, directly available from supplemental sources, or obtained from the respondent during the analytical review phase. Imputation generally is limited to a maximum of 10 percent for any one data cell. Figures with imputation rates greater than 10 percent are suppressed or footnoted. The imputation rate is not an explicit indicator of the potential error in published figures due to nonresponse, because the actual yearly movements for nonrespondents may or may not closely agree with the imputed movements. The range of difference between the actual and imputed figures is assumed to be small. The degree of uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the published data increases as the percentage of imputation increases. Figures with imputation rates above 10 percent should be used with caution.

The Shippers Export Declaration (SED) contains EIN (Employer Identification Number) of the firm that ships the exports, detailed 10-digit Harmonized System Product Code, value, quantity, export destination, date of the transaction, port, mode of transport, and whether the transaction is between related parties. The export transactions to Canada require special handling as data for exports to Canada is not collected through the SED; however, Canada collects import transaction from the U.S. which can be alternatively used as export transaction to Canada.

The transaction level data on imports (for all import shipments above $2,000 and $250 for certain quota items) is collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection via import declaration form (U.S. Customs Forms 7501 and 7533).  The Customs forms contain EIN, detailed 10-digit Harmonized System product code, value, quantity, country of origin, date of the transaction, port, mode of transport, and whether the transaction is between related parties.

Furthermore, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) dataset is merged to construct firm level measures of employment and industrial activity and to exploit the longitudinal nature of the LBD to examine firm birth and death rates. The EIN and name information (also called the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL)) from the Census Bureau Business Register is used to match the firms to the import and export transaction data. The SSEL also contains information on the firm or enterprise that owns the entity.

The extracts contain Protected Identification Keys (PIK) that link these records to the internal Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) panel data.

The Master Earnings File (MEF)
The Social Security Administration (SSA) receives reports of earnings for the U.S. working population each year. Earnings data are used to administer the Social Security programs and to conduct research on the populations served by those programs. The administrative needs of SSA and other agencies have changed over time and, as a result, there have been numerous changes to the main source of SSA\'s earnings data, which is known as the Master Earnings File (MEF). By documenting the history, content, limitations, complexities, and uses of the MEF (and data files derived from the MEF), this article serves as a resource for researchers who use earnings data to study work patterns and their implications. It is also a resource for policymakers and administrators who must understand the data used in administering current-law programs and the data available to inform potential changes to those programs.

Summary Earnings Record (SER)
ser_sipp_ext_1984-2008.sas7bdat
A SER record summarizes all earnings information found in the MEF for each year from 1951- present. All amounts reported on W-2s for jobs subject to FICA tax are added together, by year, and then capped at the FICA taxable maximum. Thus, the SER would contain the same value for total FICA earnings if a worker earned $30,000 from a single job in one year, or $30,000 from three separate $10,000 jobs in one year. Any amount earned beyond the FICA taxable maximum is not recorded.

Detailed Earnings Record (DER)
der_sipp_ext_1984-2008.sas7bdat
The DER contains individual entries for every W-2 form reported for a worker. In the above example, the DER would contain three separate entries for each $10,000 job. The DER is a person-year-EIN file where the EIN is the employer\'s tax identifier. The DER reports earnings from Box 1 of the W-2, or those earnings subject to income tax, and separately, deferred wages contributed to a tax-exempt retirement account. DER earnings are uncapped but are missing some amounts such as earnings deducted to pay health insurance premiums.

The MAFX is used to support most of the census and surveys that the Census Bureau conducts including the decennial census, the American Community Survey and ongoing demographic surveys. The content of the MAFX includes address information, Census geographic location codes, as well as source and history data.

Protected under Title 13,8 billion records in 8 files per state. Record counts per state vary.,Combination (industries),All except for agricultural workers,http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/lehddata.html,"The Employment History File (EHF) provides a full time-series of earnings at all
within-state jobs for all quarters covered by the LEHD system and provided by the state. It also provides activity calendars at a job, firm, and sub-firm reporting unit level.  The EHF contains no Federal Tax Information (FTI).","The Employment History Files (EHF) are designed to store the complete in-state
work history for each individual that appears in the UI wage records. The EHF for each state contains one record for each employee-employer combination–a job–in that state in each year. Both annual and quarterly earnings variables are available in the EHF. Individuals who are employed, but never have strictly positive earnings at their employing SEIN (a theoretical possibility) in a given year do not have a record in the EHF for that year. To facilitate analysis, the EHF data are restructured into another file containing one observation per job (PIK-SEIN combination), with all quarterly earnings and activity information available on that record. The restructured file is called the Person History File (PHF). It should be noted that the actual file
structure is at the PIK-SEIN-SEINUNIT-YEAR level for the EHF, and at the PIK-SEIN-SEINUNIT level for the PHF. Although only one state (Minnesota) has non-zero values for SEINUNIT, this allows the file structure to be homogeneous across states. An active job within a quarter, the primary job-level economic
activity measure, is defined as having strictly positive quarterly earnings for the individual-employer pair that define the job.  A time-series similar to the aggregated job data, but based on observed activity (positive employment)
in the ES-202 records, is availabe and computed at the SEINUNIT level (Unit History File, UHF) and the SEIN level (SEIN History File, SHF).","No edits have been applied to these data. Under-reporting, data loss, etc. may affect diverse states and quarters. The data documentation has an up-to-date list of such data issues.

available for the establishments of multi-unit firms in the SEIN SEINUNIT file. The SEIN file is built up from the SEINUNIT file and contains no additional information, but should be viewed merely as an easier and/or more efficient way to access firm level data.","The primary data source for the Employer Characteristics File (ECF) are the ES-
202 files. The ES-202 files contain information at both the firm and establishment level and the ECF continues this structure, but the ”master” records are removed and the firm level information is appended to the establishment data. The next major source of data comes from the UI/EHF. Person level job information is aggregated to the firm level and is merged with the ES-202 information. The union of these two data sources determines the set of records on the ECF. The ES-202 data contains among other variables, information on establishment location, Federal EIN, and industry. Any missing establishment characteristics are filled with information from the closest quarter, the firm level mode, and eventually imputed, if no firm specific information is available. The UI/EHF and the ES-202 both contribute information on payroll and
employment. Various algorithms are used to combine this information in the most sensible way possible. Finally, the address information available on the ES-202 is processed through an address standardization and Geographic Information System (GIS) processing system to create the Geocoded Address List (GAL). The resulting establishment level geocode information from the GAL is then merged back onto the ECF.","The quality of the ECF depends primarily on the quality of the incoming UI and ES-202 data as received from the state. The quality of the data is generally high for 2000 and beyond, but earlier years’ historical data files may be incomplete. Although the data undergoes various quality control checks and
imputations of missing values once received at LEHD, in some cases this is only a partial solution. States, also vary in the quality of the establishment level data reported for multi-unit firms. The lack of consistent reporting of establishment level information can greatly affect the geographic dispersion of employment and payroll. In both 1992 and 1997 efforts were made to expand the collection of establishment level data. Expansions in the number of establishments in those years are likely not related to new economic activity,
but reflect improved collection activities. Many states have only partial coverage of sectors such as agriculture, state government, and local municipalities. Federal government workers are also not typically covered. Due to limitations in the historical data, some years and quarters may not have complete coverage on both the EHF and ES-202 and this will be reflected in the ECF as well.",y,265,265

","The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Protected Identification Key (PIK) Crosswalks are used to link NCVS microdata files to other microdata files with a PIK variable.

The NCVS provides national level personal victimization and property crime rates from a general population sample. Data are gathered on types and incidence of crime; monetary losses and physical injuries due to crime; characteristics of the victims; and, where appropriate, characteristics of the offender. Periodically, the survey includes separate supplements on additional topics such as crime in schools, excessive use of force during contacts with law enforcement, identity theft, stalking, and crime in the workplace. More recently, numerous series of questions were added to the NCVS questionnaire to obtain information on important current issues such as crime against persons with disabilities, hate-related victimizations, and identity theft.

Each housing unit selected for the NCVS remains in the sample for three years, with each of seven interviews taking place at 6-month intervals. An NCVS interviewer\'s first contact with a housing unit selected for the survey is in person. Throughout the years, the mode of interviewing for the subsequent interviews (second through seventh) was changed to cut data collection costs. Currently, all subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone whenever possible.

In order to be able to rotate part of the sample in and out every six months, the sample is divided into six groups or rotations. Each rotation is then broken up into six pieces to spread the field workload over the six month period. A panel consists of one piece (one sixth) of each rotation group and is interviewed each month of the six month period.

To elicit more accurate reporting of incidents, the NCVS uses the self-respondent method, which calls for the direct interviewing of each person 12 years or older in the household, with certain exceptions.",,n,311,311
