 abstract= {The Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) provides sample estimates of statistics for all manufacturing establishments with one or more paid employee. Manufacturing is defined as the mechanical physical or chemical transformation of materials or substances into new products. The assembly of components into new products is also considered manufacturing except when it is appropriately classified as construction.

Establishments in the manufacturing sector are often described as plants factories or mills and typically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. Also included in the manufacturing sector are some establishments that make products by hand such as custom tailors and the makers of custom draperies. While manufacturers typically do not sell to the public some establishments such as bakeries and candy stores that make products on the premises may be included.

The Census Bureau conducts the ASM in each of the 4 years between the economic census which is collected for years ending in 2 and 7. The economic census is the sample frame from which the ASM is chosen and presents more detailed data than the ASM.

Each of the establishments canvassed in the ASM are classified in 1 of 473 manufacturing industries in accordance with the industry definitions in the 1997 NAICS Manual.

In the NAICS system an industry is generally defined as a group of establishments that have similar production processes. To the extent practical the system uses supply based or production-oriented concepts in defining industries. The resulting group of establishments must be significant in terms of number value added by manufacture value of shipments and number of employees.

In the 1997 Manufacturing Economic Census all establishments were classified in particular industries based on the products they produced. If an establishment made products of more than one industry it was classified in the industry with the largest product value.

The ASM is conducted on an establishment basis. A company operating at more than one location is required to file a separate report for each location or establishment selected in the sample. Companies engaged in distinctly different lines of activity at one location are requested to submit separate reports if the plant records permit such a separation and if the activities are substantial in size.

Occasionally special supplemental questions are added to the ASM in order to collect information on specific topics of interest.  For example
detailed information on fuels consumed:  quantity and cost of coal coke distillate fuel oil residual fuel oil natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gases were collected as part of the 1975-81 ASM.  Supplemental information on the use of computer networks for ordering supplies managing
inventories and managing sales etc. were collected as part of the 1999 and 2000 ASM.

 abstract= {<p>The National Crime Victimization Survey provides national level personal victimization and property crime rates from a general population sample. Data are gathered on types and incidence of crime; monetary losses and physical injuries due to crime; characteristics of the victims; and where appropriate characteristics of the offender. Periodically the survey includes separate supplements on additional topics such as crime in schools excessive use of force during contacts with law enforcement identity theft stalking and crime in the workplace. More recently numerous series of questions were added to the NCVS questionnaire to obtain information on important current issues such as crime against persons with disabilities hate-related victimizations and identity theft.</p>

<p>Each housing unit selected for the NCVS remains in the sample for three years with each of seven interviews taking place at 6-month intervals.  An NCVS interviewer's first contact with a housing unit selected for the survey is in person.  Throughout the years the mode of interviewing for the subsequent interviews (second through seventh) was changed to cut data collection costs.  Currently all subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone whenever possible.</p>

<p>In order to be able to rotate part of the sample in and out every six months the sample is divided into six groups or rotations.  Each rotation is then broken up into six pieces to spread the field workload over the six month period.  A panel consists of one piece (one sixth) of each rotation group and is interviewed each month of the six month period.</p>

<p>To elicit more accurate reporting of incidents the NCVS uses the self-respondent method which calls for the direct interviewing of each person 12 years or older in the household with certain exceptions.</p>},

Basic data are collected on the presence and plans for using advanced technologies establishment characteristics technologies and other topics. The survey covers 17 specific technologies including numerically-controlled machines computer-aided design or engineering technologies programmable controllers and local area networks. Characteristics data include type of manufacturing age of plant primary customer and price of products sold. Other basic questions include the reasons for not adopting technologies and interaction with Federal defense agencies. 

The survey is conducted periodically beginning in 1988 as needed to document changes and obtain needed new information. The first survey emphasized prevalence and plans and was replicated in 1993. A one-time survey was conducted in 1992 to detail the barriers benefits and costs of advanced technologies. Reference periods are usually for activities during the prior calendar year. 

The Department of Defense uses the data to assess the diffusion of technology in the manufacturing sector and plans to acquire technology. Other Federal agencies use the data to gauge competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing sector. The data are also used by the private sector in market analysis competitiveness assessments and planning. },

 abstract= {The Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization provides current data on the rates of capacity utilization in U.S. manufacturing plants. Data collected are for the fourth quarter and include number of days and hours worked; estimated value of production at full production capability; and estimated value of production achievable under national emergency conditions. Additional items include reasons why the plant may operate at less than full production; reasons why the estimate of full production capability changed from the prior year; and how quickly the plant could reach full production and national emergency levels of production.

Data were obtained annually since 1973; except no survey was conducted for 1989 1991 and 1993. The 1994 survey collected data for 1993 and 1994 and the 1996 survey collected data for 1995 and 1996. Since 1997 the survey has been conducted on an annual basis. Reported data are for activity taking place during the fourth quarter of the survey year; data collection begins about 2 months after the reference quarter and continues for about 8 months.  

The Federal Reserve Board uses the data to benchmark its monthly estimates of capacity output and capacity utilization rates and to formulate monetary policy. The Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency use the data in assessing industrys ability to meet increasing demand for goods in a crisis situation quickly. The International Trade Administration uses the data to identify industries with potentially adverse import penetration. 

The survey is a mail-out/mail-back survey of some 17000 manufacturing establishments selected from the census of manufactures using a stratified probability procedure. Establishments are stratified by 6-digit NAICS manufacturing industry and selected with probabilities of selection proportionate to their value of shipments within each industry.  

A new sample selection is made every 5 years when data from the most recent census become available. In interim years new establishments are identified from Federal tax records and the annual company organization survey. A sub-sample of these firms is added each year to the capacity utilization survey sample.

The LBD is updated annually - the next update scheduled for late 2006 will add data through 2004 .  

The LBD offers researchers at CES and its affiliated Research Data Centers (RDCs)  a number of features not available in other longitudinal datasets.  These include:

Long Time Series  - The LBD contains complete establishment histories from 1975 to 2005.  Precise birth and death year information are available for most establishments.

Industrial Scope - The LBD contains all employer establishments that are in scope for the Economic Census (i.e. all manufacturing mining construction retail wholesale service TCU and FIRE establishments) as well as a large number of public administration and other out of scope entities.

Improved Longitudinal linkages - In contructing the LBD great care was taken to provide researchers with the most complete and accurate set of longitudinal establishment linkages possible.  This substantially reduces the number spurious establishment births and deaths observed in the data.  In addition the LBD provides researchers with detailed flags that describe for each establishment the nature of the linkages over each year an establishment is observed in the data.

Basic establishment demographic data - The LBD contains basic information on establishment size industry location and ownership that permit researchers to analyze establishment demographics.

Linkages to other micro data - The research capabilities of the LBD can be greatly and easily enhanced by linking it to other establishment and firm information contained in Economic Census and survey files available at CES and the RDCs.

More detailed information about the LBD is available in Jarmin and Miranda (CES-WP-2002-17).

Further total R&D expenditure statistics are used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for inclusion in their System of National Accounts. Completion of four items on the questionnaire are mandated by law.

b. Respondents

The Survey of Industrial Research and Development is an annual sample survey that intends to include or represent all for-profit R&D-performing companies either publicly or privately held. The survey is completed by representatives at manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies known to conduct R&D and by representatives from samples of companies in both sectors that may conduct R&D. A company is defined as one or more establishments under common ownership or control. In some cases representatives at the establishment level return forms so that more than one form per company is returned. In these cases company data are aggregated during processing.

c. Key variables

    * Categories of research and development (basic applied and development)
    * Company size
    * Employment of scientists and engineers (full-time equivalent)
    * Equipment
    * Expenditures for research and development
    * Federal funds for R&D
    * Geographic location (within U.S.)
    * North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)
    * Research and development scientists and engineers
    * Sales
    * Source of financing (company or Federal)
    * Standard Industrial Classification system

2. Survey Design 

a. Target population and sample frame

The target population consists of all industrial companies that perform R&D in the United States. The Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) a Bureau of the Census compilation that contains information on more than 3 million establishments with paid employees is the target population from which the frame used to select the survey sample is created. For companies with more than one establishment data were summed to the company level. The frame from which the survey sample is drawn includes all for-profit companies classified in nonfarm industries. For surveys prior to 1992 the frame was limited to companies above certain size criteria based on number of employees. These criteria varied by industry. Some industries were excluded from the frame because it was believed that they contributed little or no R&D activity to the final survey estimates. For the 1992 sample new industries were added to the frame and the size criteria were lowered considerably and applied uniformly to firms in all industries. As a result nearly 2 million enterprises with 5 or more employees were given a chance of selection for subsequent samples including the 1998 sample. For comparison the frame for the 1987 sample included 154000 companies of specified sizes and industries.

b. Sample design

For the 1998 survey each firm was assigned a single Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code based on the activity of the establishment having the highest dollar value of payroll. This assignment was done on a hierarchical basis. The enterprise was first assigned to the economic division (manufacturing or nonmanufacturing) based on the aggregated payroll of its establishments then to the 2-digit SIC code with the highest payroll within the assigned division then to the 3-digit SIC code with the highest payroll within the assigned 2-digit industry.

Sampling Strata. A fundamental change initiated in 1995 and repeated for subsequent samples was the redefinition of the sampling strata. For the survey years 1992-94 165 sampling strata were established each stratum corresponding to one or more 3-digit-level SIC codes. The objective was to select sufficient representation of industries to determine whether alternative or expanded publication levels were warranted. Starting with the 1995 survey the sampling strata corresponded to publication level industry aggregations; 40 publication levels were defined. These correspond to the original 25 groupings of manufacturing industries used as sampling strata before 1992 and an additional 15 groupings of nonmanufacturing industries. Companies were assigned to strata based on their 3-digit SIC codes.

Certainty Companies. The criteria for identifying companies selected for the survey with certainty which were most recently modified in 1996 have remained the same for subsequent surveys. To limit the growth occurring each year in the number of certainty cases within the total sample the certainty criterion was raised for the 1996 survey from $1 million to $5 million in total R&D expenditures. With a fixed total sample size there was concern that the representation of the very large noncertainty universe by a smaller sample each year would be inadequate. Before 1994 companies with 1000 or more employees had been selected with certainty but it was observed that the level of spending varied considerably and that many of these companies reported no R&D expenditures each year. For these reasons it was determined that these companies should be given chances of selection based upon the size of their R&D spending if they were in the previous survey or upon an estimated R&D value if they were not. Consequently the size criteria were dropped for surveys after 1994.

Frame Partitioning. Partitioning of the frame into large and small companies was first introduced in 1994 because of concern arising from a study of 1992 survey results which showed that a disproportionate number of small companies was being selected for the sample and often assigned very large weights. These small companies seldom reported R&D activity. This disproportion was a result of the minimum probability rule used as part of the independent probability proportionate to size (pps) sampling procedure employed exclusively prior to 1994. This rule increased the probabilities of selection for several hundred thousand smaller companies. For 1994 and subsequent surveys simple random sampling (srs) was applied to the smaller company partition causing the smaller companies to be sampled more efficiently than with independent pps sampling since there was little variability in their size. The large partition continued to be sampled using independent pps sampling. In 1994 and 1995 total company payroll was the basis for partitioning the frame. For each industry grouping the largest companies representing the top 90 percent of the total payroll for the industry grouping were included in the pps frame. The balance the smaller companies comprising the remaining 10 percent of payroll for the industry grouping were included in the srs frame. Beginning in 1996 total company employment became the basis for partitioning the frame. The total company employment levels defining the partitions were based on the relative contribution to total R&D expenditures of companies in different employment size groups in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. In the manufacturing sector all companies with total employment of 50 or more were included in the large company partition. In the nonmanufacturing sector all companies with total employment of 15 or more were included in the large company partition. Companies in the respective sectors with employment below these values were included in the small company partition. In the 1998 survey the large company partition contained almost 550000 companies and the small company partition contained approximately 1.3 million companies. These counts were comparable to those in the 1997 survey (540000 and 1.3 million respectively).

"Zero" industries. One final modification in the frame development for 1996 which was repeated for subsequent surveys was the designation of "zero industries" in the large company partition. Zero industries were those three-digit SIC industries having no R&D expenditures reported in survey years 1992-1994-the years when estimates by three-digit SIC industry were formed. These industries remained within the scope of the survey but only a limited sample was drawn from them because it was unlikely that these industries conducted R&D. Simple random sampling was used to control the number of companies selected from these industries.

Sample Selection. In 1996 a significant revision in the procedure for selecting samples from the partitions led to a change in the development and presentation of estimates. The revised procedure was repeated for subsequent surveys. In 1995 the sample of companies from the large company partition was selected using probability proportionate to size sampling in each of the 40 strata. Likewise the simple random sampling of the small company partition was done for each of the 40 strata. However beginning in 1996 the number of strata established for the small company partition was reduced to two. One stratum consisted of small companies classified in manufacturing industries and the second stratum consisted of small companies classified in nonmanufacturing industries. Simple random sampling continued as the selection method for these two strata. The purpose of selecting the small company panel from these two strata was to reduce the variability in industry estimates largely attributed to the random year-to-year selection of small companies by industry and the high sampling weights that sometimes occurred. As a consequence of this change estimates for industry groups within manufacturing and nonmanufacturing were not possible from these two strata as noted on affected tables. The statistics for the detailed industry groups were based only on the sample from the large company partition. Estimates from the small company partition were included in statistics for total manufacturing total nonmanufacturing and all industries. For completeness in the affected tables the estimates also were added to the categories "other manufacturing" and "other nonmanufacturing".

c. Data collection techniques

The survey is conducted by the Census Bureau in accord with an interagency agreement with SRS. Survey instruments are mailed to company representatives in March each year with a request that they be completed by May 15. Five mail follow-ups are conducted. Phone follow-up is used with the 300 largest nonrespondent R&D performers (as determined by expenditures reported in previous surveys) that have not filed a request for extension. Two questionnaires are used each year to collect data for the survey. Known large R&D performers are sent a detailed questionnaire Form RD-1. The Form RD-1 requests data on sales or receipts total employment employment of scientists and engineers expenditures for R&D performed within the company with Federal funds and with company and other funds character of work (basic research applied research and development) company-sponsored R&D expenditures in foreign countries R&D performed under contract by others Federally funded R&D by contracting agency R&D costs by type of expense domestic R&D expenditures by State energy-related R&D and foreign R&D by country. Because companies receiving the Form RD-1 have participated in previous surveys computer-imprinted data reported by the company for the previous year are supplied for reference. Companies are encouraged to revise or update this imprinted data if they have more current information however prior-year statistics that had been previously published are revised only if large disparities were reported. Small R&D performers and firms included in the sample for the first time were sent Form RD-1A. This form collects the same information as Form RD-1 except for five items: Federal R&D support to the firm by contracting agency R&D costs by type of expense domestic R&D expenditures by State energy-related R&D and foreign R&D by country. It also includes a screening item that allows respondents to indicate that they do not perform R&D. No prior-year information is made available since the majority of the companies that receive the Form RD-1A have not been surveyed previously.

d. Estimation techniques

For various reasons many firms chose to return the survey questionnaires with one or more blank items. For some firms internal accounting systems and procedures may not have allowed quantification of specific expenditures. Others may have refused to answer any voluntary questions as a matter of company policy. When respondents did not provide the requested information estimates for the missing data were made using imputation algorithms. In general the imputation algorithms computed values for missing items by applying the average percentage change for the target item in the nonresponding firm's industry to the item's prior-year value for that firm reported or imputed. This approach with minor variation was used for most items.

3. Survey Quality Measures top

a. Sampling variability

The sample is designed to produce coefficients of variation of 2 percent for industries designated as "high priority" industries and 5 percent for other industries. The designation of "high priority" is assigned when prior surveys have identified an industry as one in which there is a large amount of R&D expenditures.

b. Coverage

Coverage error constitutes a possible source of error for the survey because the SSEL is undoubtedly missing some in-scope companies especially relatively new ones. It should be noted that coverage errors for surveys prior to 1992 were more likely because not all companies on the SSEL were subject to selection. The Census Bureau continually strengthens and updates the SSEL so that coverage error is minimized..

c. Nonresponse

(1) Unit nonresponse - Of the companies surveyed for 1998 13.2 percent did not respond. Nonresponse studies of companies that do not respond to the survey are conducted periodically to improve response rates in future surveys. Overall the magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is negligible because even if no response can be elicited from a company other sources of information about the company are used to estimate its R&D data.

(2) Item nonresponse - Companies are encouraged to estimate information when actual data are unavailable. Even so item nonresponse rates for key data elements in the survey for 1998 ranged from 1.6 percent to 68.3 percent. When estimates are not reported and cannot be elicited by following up with the respondent complex comprehensive imputation techniques developed over the survey's long history are used to minimize the effects of item nonresponse.

d. Measurement

Variations in respondent interpretations of the definitions of R&D activities and variations in accounting procedures are of particular concern. Specifically some companies have difficulty separating basic research from applied research delineating the costs of fringe benefits attributable to R&D personnel locating geographically where R&D is performed and reporting the cost of energy R&D. The sophistication and comprehensiveness of a company's accounting system often depends on its size and activities and its willingness to accommodate Government-sponsored surveys. Work was conducted recently using cognitive lab approaches to evaluate ways in which the form could be modified to ease reporting difficulties and reduce measurement error. Recommendations resulting from that work continue to be incorporated into the survey questionnaires. Other ongoing efforts to minimize measurement error include questionnaire pre-testing improvement of questionnaire wording and format inclusion of more cues and examples in the questionnaire instructions consultations with respondents post-survey evaluations record check studies and computer editing.

4. Trend Data top

The statistics resulting from this survey are better indicators of changes in rather than absolute levels of R&D spending and personnel. Nevertheless the statistics are often taken to be a continuous time series prepared using the same collection processing and tabulation methods. Such uniformity has not been the case. Since the survey was first fielded improvements have been made to increase the reliability of the statistics and to make the survey results more useful. To that end past practices have been changed and new procedures instituted. Preservation of the comparability of the statistics has however been an important consideration in making these improvements. Nonetheless changes to survey definitions the industry classification system and the procedure used to assign industry codes to multi-establishment companies have had some though not substantial effects on the comparability of statistics. The aspect of the survey that had the greatest effect on comparability was the selection of samples at irregular intervals (i.e. 1967 1971 1976 1981 1987 and 1992) and the use of a subset or panel of the last sample drawn to develop statistics for intervening years. This practice introduced cyclical deterioration of the statistics. As compensation for this deterioration periodic revisions were made to the statistics produced from the panels surveyed between sample years. Early in the survey's history various methods were used to make these revisions. After 1976 and until the 1992 advent of annual sampling a linking procedure called wedging was used. In wedging the 2 sample years on each end of a series of estimates served as benchmarks in the algorithms used to adjust the estimates for the intervening years. To that end the wedging algorithm does not change estimates from sample years and adjusts estimates from panel years recognizing that deterioration of the panel is progressive over time. One of the primary reasons for deciding to select a new sample annually rather than at irregular intervals was to avoid applying global revision processes such as wedging. Consequently the 1992 survey was intended to be the last one affected by the wedging procedure.

Effective with the 1997/1998 report companies are classified according to the 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) instead of the Standard 
Industrial Classification (SIC) system. There are differences in the ways NAICS 
and SIC classify certain types of companies.  For example manufacturers of 
prepackaged software and books are classified as manufacturers under SIC and 
as ?Other? types of companies under NAICS.  Users are advised to consider these 
differences when making year-over-year comparisons of exporters and exporter 
characteristics before and after 1997.  The Exporter Database based on new 
data for one year and revised data for the prior year uses the same

<p>The American Housing Survey (AHS) is the largest regular national housing sample survey in the United States.

The AHS contains data on apartments single-family homes mobile homes vacant homes family composition income housing and neighborhood quality housing costs equipment fuels size of housing unit and recent movers.</p>

<h4>Sample Density and Coverage</h4>

<p>National data are collected every other year from a fixed sample of about 50000 homes plus new construction each year. The survey started in 1973 and has had the same sample since 1985 allowing users to see homes and households changing over the years. In some metropolitan areas the AHS has additional samples every 4-6 years to measure local conditions.</p>

<p>The AHS conducts a national survey and a metropolitan area survey. Both surveys are conducted during a 3− to 7−month period. The national survey which gathers information on housing throughout the country interviews at about 55000 housing units every 2 years in odd−numbered years. The metropolitan area survey consists of 47 metropolitan areas where householders are interviewed every 6 years. The AHS gathers data for about 14 metropolitan areas on an even numbered year until all 47 metropolitan areas are surveyed. The cycle begins again 6 years later. Every 4 years six of the largest metropolitan areas are included with the national sample. Since 1984 each metropolitan area is represented by a sample of at least 3200 designated housing units. The units are divided between the central city and the rest of the metropolitan area.</p>

<p>A sample of housing units in all survey areas was selected from the decennial census. These are updated by a sample of addresses obtained from building permits (for new construction) to include housing units added since the sample was selected. The homes in the national survey are located in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The survey goes back to the same housing units on a regular basis recording changes in characteristics adding and deleting units when applicable. This cross−sectioning of the housing inventory gives a picture of houses and households as they change over long periods of time.</p>},

Exports measure the total physical movement of merchandise out of the United 
States to foreign countries whether such merchandise is exported from within 
the U.S. Customs territory or from a U.S. Customs bonded warehouse or a U.S. 
Foreign Trade Zone. The following are examples of some types of shipments that 
are included in the statistics but are of such a nature that their inclusion 
merits separate mention:

�	Department of Defense Military Assistance Program Grant-Aid shipments 
under the Foreign Assistance Act

�	Foreign military sales.

�	Shipments of commodities for economic assistance under the Foreign 
Assistance Act. (Totals for exports under this program are published quarterly 
or as they become available.)

�	Shipments of agricultural commodities under P.L. 480 (Agricultural 
Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954) as amended and related laws. 
(Totals for exports under this program are published as the data become 
available from the Department of Agriculture. Additional information may be 
obtained from the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture.) 

�	Sales of U.S. vessels to purchasers in foreign countries. 

�	Satellites launched by U.S. space vehicles limited to: (1) foreign 
origin and/or; (2) launched on behalf of international organizations.

Domestic Exports
Exports of domestic merchandise include commodities which are grown produced 
or manufactured in the United States and commodities of foreign origin which 
have been changed in the United States including U.S. Foreign Trade Zones 
from the form in which they were imported or which have been enhanced in value 
by further manufacture in the United States.


Foreign Exports (Re-exports)
Exports of foreign merchandise (re-exports) consist of commodities of foreign 
origin which have entered the United States for consumption or into Customs 
bonded warehouses or U.S. Foreign Trade Zones and which at the time of 
exportation are in substantially the same condition as when imported.

forms and Foreign Trade Zone documents as required by law to be filed with the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Data on imports of electricity and natural 
gas from Canada are obtained from Canadian sources.


Imports of merchandise include commodities of foreign origin as well as goods 
of domestic origin returned to the United States with no change in condition or 
after having been processed and/or assembled in other countries. 
(See discussion of American Goods Returned After Processing And/Or Assembly below).

For statistical purposes imports are classified by the type of transaction:

�	Merchandise entered for immediate consumption. ("duty free" 
merchandise and merchandise on which duty is paid on arrival).  

�	Merchandise withdrawn for consumption from Customs bonded warehouses 
and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones. 

�	Merchandise entered into Customs bonded warehouses and U.S. Foreign 
Trade Zones from foreign countries.

Bonded Warehouses
Bonded warehouses are authorized by U.S. Customs for storage or manufacturing 
of goods on which payment of duties is deferred until the goods are removed 
into Customs Territory. These goods are not subject to duties if reshipped to 
foreign points.


Foreign Trade Zones
Foreign Trade Zones are enclosed areas operated as public utilities under 
control of U.S. Customs with facilities for handling storing manipulating 
manufacturing and exhibiting goods. The merchandise may be exported 
destroyed or sent into Customs territory from the zone in the original 
package or otherwise. It is subject to Customs duties if sent into Customs 
territory but not if reshipped to foreign points.

American Goods Returned After Processing and/or Assembly
Domestically produced goods are shipped from the United States to other 
countries for processing and/or assembly and then returned to this country. 
Imports containing U.S. content which qualify for special duty-free treatment 
on the U.S. portion fall into the following groups:

�	Articles of metal manufactured in the United States which were 
exported for further processing abroad and returned to the United States for 
more processing. 


�	Textile articles assembled abroad and entered under a Special Access 
Program or Special Regime. 

�	Articles assembled abroad from components produced in the United 
States except textile articles entered under a Special Access Program or 
Special Regime.

Separate statistics are available on American goods returned after processing 
and/or assembly abroad.

General Imports
"General Imports" measure the total physical arrivals of merchandise from 
foreign countries whether such merchandise enters consumption channels 
immediately or is entered into bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones under 
Customs custody.



Imports for Consumption
"Imports for Consumption" measure the total of merchandise that has physically 
cleared through Customs either entering consumption channels immediately or 
entering after withdrawal for consumption from bonded warehouses under Customs 
custody or from Foreign Trade Zones. Many countries use the term "special 
imports" to designate statistics compiled on this basis.

In the case of data collected or obtained by NCHS Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m(d)) and the NCHS Staff Manual on Confidentiality do not permit the release of data that are either identified or identifiable to persons outside of NCHS. In order to preserve privacy and confidentiality details that might identify or facilitate the identification of persons and organizations participating in surveys and data systems are suppressed in published data products. Examples of data elements that might be abridged are geographic identifiers details of sample design and variables such as age or income that might exist in other databases.
Despite the wide dissemination of data through publications CD-ROMs web release and other mechanisms the inability to release files with for instance lower levels of geography severely limits the utility of some data for research policy and programmatic purposes and sets a boundary on one of the goals of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services i.e. to increase our capacity to provide state and local area estimates. In pursuit of this goal and in response to the research community's interest in accessing data that cannot be released using public use products because these data could be used to determine the identity of an individual or establishment (these data are referred to as confidential or restricted) NCHS established the Research Data Center (RDC). The RDC provides a mechanism whereby researchers can access detailed data files in a secure environment without jeopardizing the confidentiality of respondents. Under clearly defined conditions the RDC provides restricted access to NCHS data. The protected environment of the RDC is an efficient way for the project directors to effectively meet the needs of their data users.},

a unique research database in that it is based on a random sample of the non-
institutionalized population of the United States. It consists of U.S. Census 
Bureau data from Current Population Surveys Annual Social and Economic 
Supplements and the 1980 Census combined with death certificate information to 
identify mortality status and cause of death. The full NLMS currently consists 
of approximately 2.3 million records with over 250000 identified mortality 
cases. In the version of the extract file available to RDC researchers there 
are 637162 records with 42919 cases of mortality. This extract file is 
similar to the public-use NLMS but with geographic detail available. These 
records are taken from the Economic Supplements to the Current Population 
Survey for the period 1979 to 1981.  The content of the socio-economic 
variables available offers researchers the potential to answer questions on 
mortality differentials for a variety of important socio-economic and 
demographic subgroups not covered as extensively in other databases. The full

researchers the potential to answer questions on mortality differentials for a 
variety of important socio-economic and demographic subgroups not covered as 
extensively in other databases. This project has generated over 50 publications 
in various prominent scholarly scientific and public health related journals



Project Objective:


To provide an analytical research database for the purpose of studying the 
effect of socio-economic differentials on mortality.  Specific objectives of 
this project are:


1.	To provide answers to specific public health questions which are not 
available from other sources. 

2.	To publish research findings in scholarly scientific and health 
related journals. 

3.	To release a public-use file.  This file will be released only after 
extensive review to ensure that the confidentiality of respondents has been 
protected.  The release of the public-use file must be approved by the Census 
Bureau�s Disclosure Review Board and organizations contributing data to the 
file. 


Confidentiality of NLMS data: 

The assurance of confidentiality of Census Bureau data is provided by Title 13 
of the United States Code (U.S.C.). As such NLMS operational procedures 
carefully follow well-defined practices designed to maintain the 
confidentiality of personal records as required by Title 13. These practices 
include the prevention of disclosure through the elimination of sparse cells in 
publications the prohibited release of small-area geographical information on 
the NLMS public-use file the use of an individually assigned NLMS control 
number to identify records instead of the use of personal identifiers for these 
purposes and the restriction of persons having direct access to the NLMS 
database. A violation of Title 13 includes assessment of severe penalties 
including a prison term of up to 5 years and/or fines of up to $250000 for 
any individual found guilty of releasing confidential information. In addition 
any data acquired for NLMS purposes from an external agency is acquired under 
strict confidentiality protections and agreements that govern its use and 
subsequent release.


Sponsoring Organizations: 
The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
The National Institute on Aging (NIA) and 
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
The U.S. Census Bureau (CB) is a non-funding sponsor of the NLMS.

 title= {Census of Retail Trade YYYY-YYZZ [Data file]},
 abstract= {<h4>PURPOSE</h4>

To provide periodic and comprehensive statistics about retail establishments and activities. The United States Code Title 13 requires this census and provides for mandatory responses.

<h4>COVERAGE</h4>

Domestic establishments with payroll that retail merchandise generally without transformation and related services. These are all establishments classified in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 44-45 Retail Trade. In 1997 over 1.1 million employer establishments accounted for retail sales of nearly $2.5 trillion.

<h4>CONTENT</h4>

Basic data obtained for all establishments include kind of business geographic location dollar volume of sales annual and first quarter payroll and employment for the pay period including March 12. Establishments receiving a census form provide additional data on sales by merchandise line and industry-specific measures such as number of prescriptions sold by drug stores.

<h4>FREQUENCY</h4>

Every 5 years since 1972 for years ending in "2" and "7." From 1929 through 1967 retail trade statistics were published periodically as part of the census of business. Data collection begins in December of the census year and responses are due back in about 8 weeks. Data are requested for activities taking place during the census calendar year.

<h4>METHODS</h4>

A mail-out/mail-back data collection for establishments of multi-unit companies large single-unit employers and a sample of small employers; and administrative records data for non-selected small employers and all nonemployers. All establishments of multi-unit firms and single-unit employers with annualized payroll above a size cutoff receive a census form. A sample of small employers also receives a census form. This sample is selected using a stratified sampling procedure with strata based on industry and geography. Basic data for non-selected small employers are obtained from Federal administrative records. Estimates for sales by merchandise line and other industry-specific data are based partly on small employer sample results.


<h4>SCOPE </h4>

The Retail Trade sector (sector 44-45) comprises establishments engaged in retailing merchandise generally without transformation and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are therefore organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. This sector comprises two main types of retailers: store and nonstore retailers. Store retailers operate fixed point-of-sale locations located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. They typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption but some also serve business and institutional clients. In addition to retailing merchandise some types of store retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services such as repair and installation. As a general rule establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified here. Nonstore retailers like store retailers are organized to serve the general public but their retailing methods differ. The establishments of this subsector reach customers and market merchandise with methods such as the broadcasting of   infomercials   the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs door-to-door solicitation in-home demonstration selling from portable stalls (street vendors except food) and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale (nonstore) of products such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes are classified here. Excluded from this sector are governmental organizations classified in the covered industries except for liquor stores operated by state and local governments. Data for direct sellers with no paid employees and post exchanges ship stores and similar establishments operated on military posts by agencies of the Federal Government are not included. The basic tabulations in this report do not include data for establishments which are auxiliary (primary function is providing a service such as warehouses) to retail establishments within the same organization.

 title= {Census of Wholesale Trade YYYY-YYZZ [Data file]},
 abstract= {The Wholesale trade sector comprises establishments engaged in
wholesaling merchandise generally without transformation and
rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. 

The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of
merchandise. Wholesalers are organized to sell or arrange the purchase
or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e. goods sold to other wholesalers
or retailers) (b) capital or durable nonconsumer goods and (c) raw
and intermediate materials and supplies used in production. 

Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate
from a warehouse or office. These warehouses and offices are
characterized by having little or no display of merchandise. In
addition neither the design nor the location of the premises is
intended to solicit walk-in traffic. Wholesalers do not normally use
advertising directed to the general public. Customers are generally
reached initially via telephone in-person marketing or by specialized
advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.
Follow-up orders are either vendor-initiated or client-initiated
generally based on previous sales and typically exhibit strong ties
between sellers and buyers. In fact transactions are often conducted
between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing business
relationships. 

This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: those that sell
goods on their own account and those that arrange sales and purchases
for others for a commission or fee. 

(1) Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as
wholesale merchants distributors jobbers drop shippers
import/export merchants and sales branches. These establishments
typically maintain their own warehouse where they receive and handle
goods for their customers. Goods are generally sold without
transformation but may include integral functions such as sorting
packaging labeling and other marketing services. 

(2) Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by
others or purchasing goods on a commission basis are known as agents
and brokers commission merchants import/export agents and brokers
auction companies and manufacturers' representatives. These
establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle
the goods they sell. 

Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single
manufacturer and promote and sell the particular manufacturers'
products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers. Other
wholesalers may be connected to a retail chain or a limited number of
retail chains and only provide a variety of products needed by that
particular retail operation(s). These wholesalers may obtain the
products from a wide range of manufacturers. Still other wholesalers
may not take title to the goods but act as agents and brokers for a
commission. 

Although in general wholesaling normally denotes sales in large
volumes durable nonconsumer goods may be sold in single units. Sales
of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods
and services such as farm machinery medium and heavy duty trucks and
industrial machinery are always included in wholesale trade.

Three principal types of
activities are identified: raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and in the process incurring liabilities.  Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans
and/or purchasing securities. Putting themselves at risk they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity scale and risk. This activity is known as financial intermediation. 

Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees insurance premiums or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments. Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment. 

Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation insurance and employee benefit programs. 

In addition monetary authorities charged with monetary control are

The 1990 DEED was constructed by linking workers to establishments using establishment name and address.  The data on workers comes from the long-form sample of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing.   The 1990 long-form data provides detailed information on individuals for a 1-in-6 sample of households covering topics such as age education characteristics of housing units employment status place-of-work geography etc.  See the listing in this data information system for the 1990CEN files for a more complete discussion of this data.  The 1990 Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) contains data for establishments in the US and includes information on industry employment and payroll.  See the listing in this data information system for the SSL files for more information about this data.

By using a probabilistic matching software workers from the 1990 Census were linked to establishments in the 1990 SSEL.  Of the workers from the 1990 Census that were available for matching 22% were successfully linked to establishments.  Unlike prior datasets constructed at CES that linked these two datasets all in-scope industries are represented in the data.  The data appears to be quite representative of the source data sets both from the worker side and the establishment side.  Stringent match criteria was used to avoid false matches.

The 1990 DEED is the third in a series of data sets created at CES linking workers from the 1990 Decennial Census to establishments from the 1990 SSEL.  The Worker Establishment Characteristics Database (WECD) is restricted to only manufacturing establishments.  The New Worker Establishment Characteristics Database (NWECD) covers a broader set of industries but is similar to the WECD in that only establishments that are in unique industry-location cells are available for linking.  This means that urban areas and agglomerated industries are poorly represented in the WECD and NWECD.  By using name and address matching the 1990 DEED overcomes those problems.  For most research needs the 1990 DEED is a better choice than the WECD or NWECD.

 abstract= {The Census of Transportation Communications and Utilities (CUT) includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo warehousing and
storage for goods scenic and sightseeing transportation and support
activities related to modes of transportation. Establishments in these
industries use transportation equipment or transportation related
facilities as a productive asset. The type of equipment depends on the
mode of transportation. The modes of transportation are air rail
water road and pipeline. 

The Transportation and Warehousing component distinguishes three basic
types of activities: mode of transportation warehousing and storage and providing support activities for transportation. In addition there are establishments that provide passenger transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes postal services and courier services.  Many of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks with physical facilities labor forces and equipment spread over an extensive geographic area. Warehousing  stablishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse establishments do not sell the goods.

Industries in the Broadcasting and Telecommunications include
establishments providing point-to-point communications and the services
related to that activity. The industry groups (Radio and Television
Broadcasting Cable Networks and Program Distribution and
Telecommunications) are based on differences in the methods of
communication and in the nature of services provided. The Radio and
Television Broadcasting industry group includes establishments that
operate broadcasting studios and facilities for over the air or
satellite delivery of radio and television programs of entertainment
news talk and the like. These establishments are often engaged in the
production and purchase of programs and generating revenues from the
sale of air time to advertisers and from donations subsidies and/or
the sale of programs. The Cable Networks and Program Distribution
industry group includes two types of establishments. Those in the Cable
Networks industry operate studios and facilities for the broadcasting
of programs that are typically narrowcast in nature (limited format
such as news sports education and youth-oriented programming). The
services of these establishments are typically sold on a subscription
or fee basis. Delivery of the programs to customers is handled by other
establishments in the Cable and Other Program Distribution industry
that operate cable systems direct-to-home satellite systems or other
similar systems. The Telecommunications industry group is primarily
engaged in operating maintaining and/or providing access to
facilities for the transmission of voice data text sound and full
motion picture video between network termination points. A transmission
facility may be based on a single technology or a combination of
technologies. 

The Utilities component comprises establishments engaged in the
provision of the following utility services: electric power natural
gas steam supply water supply and sewage removal. Within this
sector the specific activities associated with the utility services
provided vary by utility: electric power includes generation
transmission and distribution; natural gas includes distribution;
steam supply includes provision and/or distribution; water supply
includes treatment and distribution; and sewage removal includes
collection treatment and disposal of waste through sewer systems and
sewage treatment facilities.},

The series is useful for studying the economic activity of small businesses at various geographic levels.  Most types of businesses covered by the Census Bureau economic statistics programs are included in the nonemployer statistics. Tax-exempt businesses are excluded. All of the Agriculture Forestry Fishing and Hunting sector except crop and animal production are covered in nonemployer statistics; these industries typically are not covered in other Census Bureau economic programs. Nonemployer businesses are generally small such as real estate agents and independent contractors. Although nonemployers constitute a large part of the business universe in terms of number of establishments they contribute a relatively small portion of the overall sales and receipts data.  
  Nonemployer statistics have been released every 5 years since 1972 for years ending in 2 and 7 for selected industries in conjunction with economic census publications.  Nonemployer statistics data originate chiefly from administrative records of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Data are primarily comprised of sole proprietorship businesses filing IRS Form 1040 Schedule C although a small percentage of the data is derived from filers of partnership and corporation tax returns that report no paid employees.

Congress mandated that the Census Bureau continue to collect data on the 1992 and 1993 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) as necessary to obtain information on changes in program participation employment earnings and measures of adult and child well-being through SPD. The data collected from the 1992 and 1993 SIPP panels provided us with three years of longitudinal baseline data prior to major welfare reform. Data collected in these panels include program eligibility access and participation transfer income and in-kind benefits detailed economic and demographic data on employment and job transitions income and family composition. The three years of SIPP data combined with the seven years of SPD data will provide panel data for ten years.},

 abstract= {The Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES) is a firm-level survey
designed to collect industry-level data on capital investment in new and
used structures and equipment.  In certain years additional detail on
expenditure by asset type (by industry) is collected.  All non-farm sectors
of the economy are covered by the survey.

From 1993-1995 the ACES sample consisted of 27000-30000 companies with 5
or more employees.  In 1993 and 1995 an abbreviated survey form (ACE-2)
was sent to 15000 companies with under 5 employees or no employees
(non-employers).  Since 1996 the sample has consisted of roughly
32000-44000 companies with employees and 12000-15000 companies with no
employees (who received an abbreviated survey form).

Firms are asked to provide capital expenditures data for each industry in
which they had activity and to classify these expenditures as new or used
and as structures equipment or other.  Respondents were also asked to
report new structures and equipment acquired under capital lease agreements
entered into during the survey year and capitalized interest incurred to
produce or construct new fixed assets during the survey year.  In addition
certain data on total assets depreciation & retirements and sales/revenue
are also collected.

Prior to 1999 capital expenditure data was collected on almost 100
industries at the two- to three-digit SIC level of detail (exhausting the
non-farm sectors of the economy).  Since 1999 data are collected on about
134 non-farm industries at the three- to four-digit NAICS level of detail.
In addition a category was provided for classifying a firm's structures
and equipment expenditures serving multiple industries; for example
headquarters regional offices and central research laboratories.

In certain years of the ACES firms are asked to break down their
investment expenditures by type of structure and by type of equipment (in
addition to breaking it down by industry). For example in 1994 firms were
asked to provide detail on their structure expenditure.  In 1998 detail on
both structure and equipment expenditure was asked.  The ACES recognizes
approximately 29 different categories of structure expenditure and 26
different categories of equipment expenditure.

CES has ACES microdata from reference years 1993 to the present.  Additionally expense data is available from the Information & Communication Technology  (ICT) Survey for 2003. Data are typically released 15-17 months after the end of the reference year.  We do not currently have the data from the test surveys of 1991 and 1992.

Note: Content and survey design may/will vary slightly from year to year.

additional detail about a particular year's survey as well as sample survey

The LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) provides researchers with the tool to make this linkage.  The primary bridge between the LEHD data and the business data is the U.S. Census Bureau's annual Business Register (BR) a list of establishments the Bureau uses to develop the initial mailing list for the economic censuses and surveys.  The BR contains data from different sources.  Primarily the BR contains very reliable information on business identifiers business organizational structure and business location.  All of this detail helps to form links to the LEHD data.  Establishment to establishment linkages between LEHD data and the Business Register are not possible.  The establishment identification system for the BR is the same as for all other Census Bureau business data but differs from the LEHD establishment identifier.  There is no one best way to form linkages between these data sources.  There are many alternatives and the optimal linking strategy depends on the research objective.  To provide researchers with as much flexibility as possible the BRB has been constructed as a crosswalk that allows for a number of different ways to integrate these data sources.},

Employee training included organization purposes formal and informal programs duration trainees and effectiveness. Business characteristics included year operations began company and establishment size principal product and exports. Equipment and technology included capital assets recent investments age of equipment use of computers and research activities.

The first survey primarily collected information on establishment performance in 1993. Some information was also collected for earlier years.  Questions regarding work practices refer to the time of the survey.  Data collection began in August 1994 and continued for about 8 weeks; a follow-up conducted in 1996 collected information about 1995. 

Data were collected using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey of 3100 establishments supplemented by historical census and survey performance (productivity) measures for most manufacturing establishments. A stratified random sample of establishments with 20 or more employees was randomly selected from the Census Bureau's Business Register (BR) with strata defined by business size and type of activity. The sample was evenly divided between manufacturers and nonmanufacturers with explicit oversampling within industry strata of establishments that had 100 or more employees.  Historical performance measures for manufacturing establishments were obtained from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Respondents received an introductory letter describing the survey but because this was a telephone survey no printed form.

The survey was repeated in August 1997 (the NES II).  The NES II sample had three components.  The first used the same sample design as the first NES (except that it did not cover the states mentionned below) and had about 2500 establishments.  The second component was a sample of about 2000 additional establishments in states involved in particular educational reform programs (California Kentucky Michigan Maryland and Pennsylvania) to ensure larger-than-representative samples in those states.

Since the ACS is conducted every year rather than once every ten years it provides more current data throughout the decade.</p>

<h4>Coverage and Sample Density</h4>

<p>The ACS is an ongoing survey that provides data on an annual basis. The ACS is a national survey sent to about 250000 households each month or about 3000000 households per year.  The ACS began in 1996 collecting data in a limited number of areas. The survey expanded in subsequent years reaching full national coverage in 2005. The Census Bureau now conducts the ACS in every county of the United States.

<h4>Single-Year and Multi-Year Data</h4>

<p>Beginning in 2008 the ACS combines data collected over the previous three years to provide aggregate data to the public for all areas of 20000 or more.  Beginning in 2009 the ACS also combines data collected over the preceding five years to provide aggregate data to the public for small areas less than 20000 with accuracy similar to the decennial census. The restricted access microdata files have also been combined in multi-year files with a few modifications to the data to produce a unified file: First the weights have been recalculated so that they roll up to the national total in the most recent year in the dataset.  Second all geography has been reconciled to be consistent with the most recent year. Third dollar values have been adjusted for inflation.  Fourth in those cases where a question has changed the multi-year data reflects a "lowest common denominator" version of that variable so for example if valid responses to a survey question were changed from continuous to categorical the continuous responses from earlier years would be changed to valid categorical values.  Fifth only those questions asked in all years will be included in the multi-year data files.  That is if a question is added to the survey or dropped from the survey during the five-year period that variable will not be included in the five-year data file.

 abstract= {An annual mail-out/mail-back survey of some selected companies. Smaller companies are selected where separate administrative data indicate a probable organizational change and by a probability sampling procedure. Both larger and smaller companies are identified from those maintained on the Business Register.

Data is collected from the Report of Organization Survey the Annual Survey of Manufactures and added to administrative records.

For years ending in 2 and 7 (census years) companies report only on basic company affiliation and operations of establishments not within scope of the economic censuses. For non-census years all multi-establishment companies with 250 or more employees report survey information. For non-census years smaller companies are divided into panels and may be selected to report information for one of the years. Smaller companies may be selected because an operating change is indicated or by a probability sampling procedure.

Forms include a pre-printed list of establishments previously identified as owned by the company and space for the company to report additional establishments. Forms for single establishment companies collect information on each location operated to determine if the companies actually have more than one establishment. Reports submitted by electronic methods have grown to cover some 40 percent of all surveyed establishments. },

Proposals will be accepted by CES beginning July 1 2007 to use AHRQ data sets. AHRQ has specified a proposal format on their data center website and will handle all proposal review and also disclosure avoidance review for their data; they have agreed to waive their fee for creating the researcher's data extract for RDC researchers. Standard Census RDC access charges if any will apply. Proposals to use their data at any site other than their headquarters site in Rockville MD will be submitted through the standard Census RDC proposal process but will not have to meet Census Bureau standards just AHRQ standards (see their website). (Proposals to use confidential data from both the Census Bureau and the AHRQ must use the existing Census Bureau application procedure and will also be reviewed by AHRQ and the Internal Revenue Service if tax data is involved.)

All researchers will need to become Special Sworn Status (SSS) employees of the Census Bureau -- in case of incidental access to confidential Census Bureau or Internal Revenue Service data while in an RDC -- and will also be required to become National Center for Health Statistics agents (as AHRQ data is based on the National Health Interview Survey) and take the appropriate training for both roles.

Researchers currently using the Rockville AHRQ data center will be able to transfer their research to a Census RDC site once they become SSS employees. Contact the appropriate Census RDC Administrator for more information on the SSS process.

For more information on the proposal process or the datasets see the AHRQ data center web site at http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/onsite_datacenter.jsp

Currently annual ILBD files are available for 1977 1982 1987 1992 and 1994-2001 and there are plans to extend the timeframe to 2005 in the near future.  The ILBD is an invaluable tool for researchers investigating the dynamics of the roughly 20 million nonemployer businesses in the U.S. economy.  Researchers armed with the ILBD can investigate nonemployer business entry and exit gross revenue flows and when used in conjunction with the ILBD transitions between nonemployer and employer status over time.  The ILBD can be used alone or in conjunction with several other Census Bureau datasets on firms and individuals.

The ILBD was developed with support of the Census Bureau and the Kauffman Foundation.},
 title= {Integrated Longitudinal Business Database YYYY-YYZZ [Data file]},
 abstract= {Constructing an Integrated Longitudinal Business Database

A.  Overview of Main Tasks and Previous Work

In terms of data development our objective is to build a fully Integrated Longitudinal Business-level Database (ILBD) that covers all employer and nonemployer business units in the nonfarm private U.S. economy. We construct the initial version of the ILBD for the years 1992 and 1994-2000 and we plan updates for later years in future enhancements of the ILBD.  Key data on nonemployers are unavailable for 1993. 

From an analytical perspective the presence or absence of employees is simply another business characteristic to be measured. From a database development perspective however integrating the Census Bureau’s employer and nonemployer business universes is a major undertaking.  The main tasks fall into three categories.  One task is to integrate the employer and nonemployer universes on a year-by-year basis ensuring that each unique business entity is counted once and only once.  A second task is to construct longitudinal links for business units within each universe.  A third task is to construct contemporaneous and dynamic ownership links across universes between employer and nonemployer business units.  To carry out these tasks we build on previous work by Jarmin and Miranda (2003) to create the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) which contains annual data from 1975 to 2001 for all nonfarm private employers. We also build on previous efforts to construct longitudinal links within the nonemployer universe by Nucci and Boden (2003) and Boden and Nucci (2004). 

B.  Source Data for the ILBD

Census Bureau business registers draw on payroll tax records corporate and individual income tax returns applications for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) and various Census Bureau business surveys.  The data available to the Census Bureau depend on the legal and tax status of a business and in certain respects on the size of the business and the number of its locations. For large corporations routine data inputs include payroll records and particular items from corporate income tax returns augmented by direct Census Bureau collections for multi-location companies. For sole proprietors partnerships and single-location corporations with employees routine data inputs include payroll records certain items from income tax returns and periodic Census Bureau surveys such as the quinquennial Economic Census.  For nonemployer businesses routine data inputs derive mainly from income tax returns. 
   
Linking records from different sources requires common business identifiers.  Businesses with employees have unique Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and other Census Bureau identifiers.  Some nonemployer businesses also have an EIN but most do not and instead are tracked by the person ID of the business owner i.e. his or her Protected Identification Key (PIK) (the PIK is a Census Bureau analog to the SSN). 

To construct the ILBD we must first ensure that administrative data from each universe are cleaned and ready for integration.  On the employer side this task has been largely accomplished in the work to create the LBD. The LBD contains high-quality longitudinal links for establishments and for the most part it is easy to accurately determine establishment age.  Longitudinal establishment links are relatively straightforward to construct because they are one to one and because establishments typically have well-defined physical locations.  Firms are more difficult to track over time partly because firm-level links can be many to many.  Work is underway at the Census Bureau to develop a rich set of longitudinal firm linkages.  In the meantime we define the age of a firm in the LBD as the age of its oldest establishment.

Longitudinal links are difficult to construct in the nonemployer universe for some of the same reasons that they are difficult to construct for firms in the employer universe.  For example when there is a change in the legal or tax status of a nonemployer business its EIN or person ID can also change. (Person IDs do not change for individuals but ownership changes can yield a change in the person ID associated with a business.)  In these instances it is not straightforward to maintain longitudinal links for nonemployer businesses using data items that are routinely included in the Census Bureau’s administrative records systems. On the employer side direct Census Bureau collections provide this additional information but there is no ready equivalent on the nonemployer side. Hence in the face of changes in legal and tax status longitudinal links for nonemployers require matching algorithms based on data items such as business name location and industry.

Linking records across the employer and nonemployer business universes is further complicated by differences in the underlying administrative data and differences in the unit of analysis.  The Census Bureau’s Employer Business Register which underlies the LBD is a list of establishments (physical locations) maintained to serve as a mailing list for the Economic Census and as a frame for a variety of surveys. It relies heavily on administrative data and is augmented by direct Census Bureau collections.  Longitudinal linking is facilitated by establishment IDs (LBD Numbers and Permanent Plant Numbers or PPNs) EINs enterprise IDs (Alphas) and business name and address information.  In contrast the Census Bureau’s Nonemployer Business Register consists entirely of administrative data.  The unit of analysis is a business entity as recorded on a tax return.  Our longitudinal links for nonemployer businesses currently exploit EINs person IDs in the form of PIKs business name information and geographic information.  One complication arises when an individual taxpayer reports income for multiple nonemployer businesses. For example multiple Schedule C forms can be attached to a single 1040 tax form. We deal with these cases by aggregating to the level of a single tax filing which is associated with a unique person ID or EIN.  We then create longitudinal links across years using these numeric identifiers and business name.  We describe our procedure for linking records across the business universes below. 

C.	The Matching Algorithm

[Note: This section describes the matching algorithm used to construct a prototype ILBD.  It utilizes both matches based on common numeric identifiers (e.g. EINs) and character based information such as business name and address.  The vast majority of all linkages (both longitidinal links within the nonemployer universe and links across the nonemployer and employer universes) where based on numeric linkages.  Due to time and other constraints the first version of the ILBD to be deployed to the RDCs is based on numeric linkages only.  Subsequent versions will incorporate name and address linkages as well.]

In addition to the longitudinal links within each universe we created a set of links between the employer and nonemployer universes for our selected industries.  These links make use of numeric identifiers business names and other data items found on records in both universes. The numeric identifier for most nonemployer businesses is the owner’s PIK.  We have several numeric identifiers available in the Employer Business Register and from the LBD.  The most useful for our purposes is the EIN but many records in the Employer Business Register contain both an EIN and a PIK.  For example when a business owner applies for an EIN he or she must fill out an SS-4 form for the IRS.  This form includes the business name the PIK of the business owner or chief officer and the EIN all of which are included in the administrative records system in the Census Bureau business registers.  

We take a conservative approach in matching records across the nonemployer and employer universes.  In particular we rely only on the EIN and PIK numeric identifiers and business name. Previous efforts to develop longitudinal identifiers for the LBD have shown that linkages can be significantly improved by the use of more sophisticated probabilistic matching algorithms that exploit all of the relevant available information and that take into account the reliability of the information.  We plan to incorporate some of these techniques in future enhancements of the ILBD.  For now given the conservative nature of our algorithm we understate the incidence of linkages between the two universes.  For the same reason we also understate the contribution of nonemployer businesses to the formation of employer businesses. 

Since multiple establishments can have the same numeric and name identifiers it is important to “unduplicate” the files by year and identifier before proceeding to match them to the nonemployer universe by EIN PIK or name.  In the employer universe the most common form of duplication arises when a multi-location company operates many establishments under one EIN or business name.  We perform the match using a file that contains only one record per unique value of the linking variables.  We are most confident about cross-universe matches based on numeric identifiers.  Therefore we search for matches based on EIN PIK and business name in that order. We experimented with a number of name-matching procedures including the removal of vowels various symbols and commonly used abbreviations (“inc.” “ltd” etc.).  However after examining a sample of matches we concluded that literal name strings produced highly reliable matches and appeared to miss very few “good” matches.

COMPOSITION OF INDUSTRY CATEGORIES
There are 89 separately tabulated industry categories in the M3 survey. These categories are groupings of the 473 manufacturing industries as defined in the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Manual. Chapter B lists these categories. Because companies provide data on a voluntary basis reporting in many of these 89 categories is not sufficient to warrant separate publication of the data. Consolidated reporting by some large companies also limits the quality of the data in some categories. A company that reports on a
consolidated basis (entire company or a division) is included in the M3 category in which the reporting unit as a whole is classified and has no influence on the movement of the other industries which may be included in its combined report.
As a result it has been necessary to combine the 89 industry categories into 59 publication levels for shipments and total inventories. For new and unfilled orders and inventories by stage of fabrication it has been necessary to introduce further combinations because of the lower response rates for those items.

COMPOSITION OF THE SURVEY PANEL
The monthly M3 estimates are based on information obtained from most manufacturing companies with $500 million or more in annual shipments. In order to strengthen the sample coverage in individual industry categories the survey includes selected smaller companies. The sources from which companies are identified for inclusion in the survey panel are the quinquennial economic censuses manufacturing sector and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM).
For firms that operate in a single M3 industry category the reporting unit typically comprises all operations of the company. Most large diversified companies however file separate reports for divisions with significant activity in different industrial areas. The composition of each company or reporting unit of a company in the survey usually includes more than one plant or establishment and frequently includes industry activities outside the M3
category in which it is classified. The survey methodology described later in this chapter assumes that the month-to-month changes of the total operations of the reporting units classified in each industry category effectively represent the month-to-month movements of all establishments that make up the category.
In 1962 the initially selected sample for this survey included all companies with more than 1000 employees and smaller companies selected with probabilities proportional to their employment size within each industry category. As there was some deterioration in response rates for companies with between 100 and 1000 employees in January 1975 the staff selected a supplemental sample of approximately 1000 companies from the universe of companies in this size range in order to strengthen the estimates. Although the response rate was only about 60 percent for this...},

 title= {Services Annual Survey YYYY-YYZZ [Data file]},
 abstract= {Introduction
The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Service Annual Survey (SAS) to provide national estimates of annual revenues and expenses of establishments classified in select service sectors.

We develop the estimates in this report using data from a probability sample and administrative data. Survey questionnaires are mailed to a probability sample that is regularly updated and periodically re-selected from a universe of firms located in the United States and having paid employees. The sample includes firms of all sizes and covers both taxable firms and firms exempt from Federal income taxes. Firms without paid employees (nonemployers) are included in the estimates through administrative data provided by other Federal agencies and through imputation.

Coverage
The estimates contained in this report are summarized by industry classification based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The NAICS groups establishments into industries based on the activities in which they are primarily engaged. This system developed jointly by the statistical agencies of Canada Mexico and the United States allows for comparisons of business activity across North America.

SAMPLE DESIGN AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURES
A new sample was introduced with the 2005 Service Annual Survey (SAS). The new sample was designed to produce estimates based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This section describes the design selection and estimation procedures for the new sample. For descriptions of prior samples see the Service Annual Survey publications.

Sampling Frame
The sampling frame used for the Service Annual Survey (SAS) has two types of sampling units represented: Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and large multiple-establishment firms. Both sampling units represent clusters of one or more establishments owned or controlled by the same firm. The information used to create these sampling units was extracted from data collected as part of the 2002 Economic Census and from establishment records contained on the Census Bureau's Business Register as updated to December 2004. The next few paragraphs give details about the Business Register; the distinction between firms EINs and establishments; and the construction of the sampling units. Though important they are not essential to understanding the basic sample design and readers may continue to the Stratification Sampling Rates and Allocation section.

The Business Register is a multi-relational database that contains a record for each known establishment that is located in the United States or one of its territories and has paid employees. An establishment is a single physical location where business transactions take place and for which payroll and employment records are kept. Groups of one or more establishments under common ownership or control are firms. A single-unit firm owns or operates only one establishment. A multiunit firm owns or operates two or more establishments. The treatment of establishments on the Business Register differs according to whether the establishment is part of a single-unit or multiunit firm. In particular the structure of an establishment’s primary identifier on the Business Register differs depending on whether it is owned by a single-unit firm or by a multiunit firm.

A single-unit firm’s primary identifier is its EIN. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues the EIN and the firm uses it as an identifier to report social security payments for its employees under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). The same act requires all employer firms to use EINs. Each employer firm is associated with at least one EIN and only one firm can use a given EIN. Because a single-unit firm has only one establishment there is a one-to-one relationship between the firm and the EIN. Thus the firm the EIN and the establishment all reference the same physical location and all three terms can be used interchangeably and unambiguously when referring to a single-unit firm.

For multiunit firms however a different structure connects the firm with its establishments via the EIN. Essentially a multiunit firm is associated with a cluster of one or more EINs and EINs are associated with one or more establishments. A multiunit firm consists of at least two establishments. Each firm is associated with at least one EIN and only one firm can use a given EIN. However one multiunit firm may have several EINs. Similarly there is a one-to-many relationship between EINs and establishments. Each EIN can be associated with many establishments but each establishment is associated with only one EIN. Because of the possibility of one-to-many relationships we must distinguish between the firm its EINs and its establishments. The multiunit firm that owns or controls a particular establishment is identified on the Business Register by way of the establishment’s primary identifier.

The primary identifier of an establishment owned by a multiunit firm consists of a unique combination of an alpha number and a plant number. The alpha number identifies the multiunit firm and the plant number identifies a particular establishment within that firm. All establishments owned or controlled by the same multiunit firm have the same alpha number. Different multiunit firms have different alpha numbers and different establishments within the same multiunit firm have different plant numbers. The Census Bureau assigns both the alpha number to the multiunit firm and plant numbers to the corresponding establishments based on the results of the quinquennial economic census and the annual Company Organization Survey.

To create the sampling frame we extract the records for all establishments located in the United States and classified in select service sectors as defined by the 2002 NAICS. For these establishments we extract revenue payroll employment name and address information as well as primary identifiers and for establishments owned by multiunit firms associated EINs.

To create the sampling units for multiunit firms we aggregate the economic data of the establishments owned by these firms to an EIN level by tabulating the establishment data for all service establishments associated with the same EIN. Similarly we aggregate the data to a multiunit firm level by tabulating the establishment data for all service establishments associated with the same alpha number. No aggregation is necessary to put single-unit establishment information on an EIN basis or a firm basis. Thus the sampling units created for single-unit firms simultaneously represent establishment EIN and firm information. In summary the sampling frame is a complex amalgam of establishments EINs and firms.

Stratification Sampling Rates and Allocation
The primary stratification of the sampling frame is by industry group based on the detail required for publication. We further stratify the sampling units within industry group by a measure of size (substratify) related to their annual revenue. Sampling units expected to have a large effect on the precision of the estimates are selected “with certainty.” This means they are sure to be selected and will represent only themselves (i.e. have a selection probability of 1 and a sampling weight of 1). Within each industry stratum we determine a substratum boundary (or cutoff) that divides the certainty units from the noncertainty units. We base these cutoffs on a statistical analysis of data from the 2002 Economic Census. Accordingly these values are on a 2002 revenue basis. We also used this analysis to determine the number of size substrata for each industry stratum and to set preliminary sampling rates needed to achieve specified sampling variability constraints on revenue estimates for different industry groups. The size substrata and sampling rates are later updated through analysis of the sampling frame.

Sample Selection
The first step in the sample selection identified firms selected with certainty: the estimated annual revenue of the firm was greater than the corresponding certainty cutoff.

All firms not selected with certainty were subjected to sampling on an EIN basis. If a firm had more than one EIN we treated each of its EINs as a separate sampling unit. To be eligible for the initial sampling an EIN had to have nonzero payroll in 2003. The EINs were stratified according to their major industry and their estimated revenue (on a 2002 basis). Within each noncertainty stratum a simple random sample of EINs was selected without replacement.

Sample Maintenance
Periodically we update the sample to represent new EINs appearing on the Business Register. These new EINs called births are EINs recently assigned by the IRS on the latest available IRS mailing list for FICA taxpayers and assigned an industry classification (if possible) by the Social Security Administration (SSA).

The EIN births are sampled on a quarterly basis using a two-phase selection procedure. To be eligible for selection a birth must either have no industry classification or be classified in an industry within the scope of SAS the Annual Wholesale Trade Survey (AWTS) or the Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS) and it must meet certain criteria regarding its number of paid employees or quarterly payroll. In the first phase births are stratified by broad industry groups and a measure of size based on quarterly payroll. A relatively large sample is selected using equal probability systematic sampling. The selected births are canvassed to obtain a more reliable measure of size consisting of sales in 2 recent months company affiliation information and a new or more detailed industry classification code. Births that haven’t returned their questionnaire after 30 days are contacted by telephone.

Using this more reliable information the selected births from the first phase are subjected to probability proportional-to-size sampling with overall probabilities equivalent to those used in drawing the initial SAS AWTS and ARTS samples from the December 2004 Business Register. Because of the time it takes for a new employer firm to acquire an EIN from the IRS and because of the time needed to accomplish the two-phase birth-selection procedure births are added to the sample approximately 9 months after they begin operation.

The births that are selected in the quarterly birth-selection procedure in November of the survey year are included in the initial mailing of the SAS questionnaires in January of the following year. To better represent all EIN births in the reference year and specifically to account for the time it takes to identify and select new EINs we add births to the SAS sample that are selected in February May and August the year following the reference year. We mail survey forms to these births in June and August to supplement the initial survey mailing.

To be eligible for the sample canvass and tabulation an EIN selected in the noncertainty sampling operations must meet both of the following requirements:

    * It must be on the latest available IRS mailing list for FICA taxpayers from the previous quarter.
    * It must have been selected from the Business Register in either the initial sampling or during the quarterly birth-selection procedure.

If a firm was selected with certainty and had more than one establishment at the time of sampling any new establishments that the firm acquires even if under new or different EINs are included in the sample with certainty. However if a single-unit firm was selected with certainty only future establishments associated with that firm’s originally-selected EIN are included in the sample with certainty; any new EINs that might later be associated with that firm are subjected to sampling through the quarterly birth-selection procedure.
EINs selected into the sample with certainty are not dropped from canvass and tabulation if they are no longer on the IRS mailing list. Rather the firm that used the EIN is contacted and if a successor EIN is found it is added to the survey. For both inactive and reactivated EINs data are tabulated for only the portion of the reference year that these EINs reported payroll to the IRS.},

The final industry groups for both 2007 and 2008 were defined by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Data are obtained from manufacturing and publishing establishments by means of a mailed questionnaire. Respondents are asked to report actual production and an estimate of their full production capability. From these reported values a full utilization rate is calculated.  Final utilization rates are based on information collected from approximately 7600 manufacturing and publishing establishments. 

Plant Capacity is broadly defined as the maximum or optimum level of production or output.  The purpose of the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (QPC) is to provide statistics on the rates of capacity utilization for the U.S. manufacturing and publishing sectors on a quarterly basis. The survey is conducted jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board.

The Quarterly Plant Capacity Utilization Survey collects the plant's actual production and the estimated value of production at full production capability. It also collects data on work patterns by shift including number of days and hours worked and number of production workers.  

We calculate rates of capacity utilization in U.S. manufacturing and publishing plants. An industry's capacity utilization rate is the ratio of actual value of production to the level of production at full production capability.

Since 1904 with its cotton and fats and oils surveys the CIR program has formed an essential part of an integrated statistical system involving the quinquennial economic census manufacturing sector and the annual survey of manufactures. The CIR surveys however provide current statistics at a more detailed product level than either of the other two statistical programs.

The primary objective of the CIR program is to produce timely accurate data on production and shipments of selected products. The data are used to satisfy economic policy needs and for market analysis forecasting and decision making in the private sector. Individual firms trade associations and market analysts in planning or recommending marketing and legislative strategies use the product-level data generated by these surveys extensively particularly if their industry is significantly affected by foreign trade. Although production and shipments information are the two most common data items collected the CIR program collects other measures also such as inventories orders and consumption. These surveys measure manufacturing activity in important commodity areas such as textiles and apparel chemicals primary metals computer and electronic components industrial equipment aerospace equipment and consumer goods.

The CIR program uses a unified data collection processing and publication system. The U.S. Census Bureau updates the survey panels for most reports annually and reconciles the estimates to the results of the broader-based annual survey of manufactures and the economic census manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector provides a complete list of all producers of the products covered by the CIR program and serves as the primary source for CIR sampling. Where a small number of producers exist CIR surveys cover all known producers of a product. However when the number of producers is too large cutoff and random sampling techniques are used. Surveys are continually reviewed and modified to provide the most up-to-date information on products produced. The CIR program includes a group of mandatory and voluntary surveys. Typically the monthly and quarterly surveys are conducted on a voluntary basis. Those companies that choose not to respond to the voluntary surveys are required to submit a mandatory annual counterpart corresponding to the more frequent survey.},

Approximately 214000 people were selected for the 1993 NSCG from those cases that had completed the 1990 decennial census long form and indicated that they had received at least a bachelor\'s degree in addition to other sampling criteria. Follow-up surveys were conducted every two years and included only individuals identified in the 1993 survey as having an S&E degree and/or an S&E occupation who responded in the prior survey year and who met other eligibility criteria (e.g. age criteria). During the follow-up years a small sample of NSRCG respondents was also July 15th surveyed as part of the NSCG. The 1999 NSCG was the last interview panel for the 1990s. The 2003 NSCG is the baseline survey for the decade of the 2000s. Approximately 177320 people were initially
selected for the 2003 NSCG new cohort sample from those cases that had completed the 2000 decennial census long form and indicated that they had received at least a bachelor\'s degree in addition to other sampling criteria. The final 2003 NSCG new cohort sample size was 170797 cases after some adjustments were made to the sampling frame. An additional 40073 cases were selected for the 2003 NSCG old cohort sample from respondents to the 1999 NSCG
(originally from either the 1993 NSCG or the 1993-1997 NSRCG) the 1999 NSRCG or the 2001 NSRCG. Follow-up surveys are conducted every two or three years and include only individuals identified in the 2003 NSCG new cohort survey as having an S&E degree and/or an S&E occupation who responded in the prior survey year and who met other eligibility criteria (e.g. age criteria). During the follow-up years a small sample of respondents to the 2001 and later NSRCGs was also surveyed as part of the NSCG. The survey sample size for the 2008 NSCG was the same as for the 2006 NSCG (68000 cases). In 2010 the Census discontinued the use of the long form so the American Community Survey (ACS) was used as a
sampling frame for the 2010 NSCG and 2013 NSCG. Additionally the surveys now include individuals identified as having received at least a bachelor\'s degree in any field.

The Master Earnings File (MEF)
The Social Security Administration (SSA) receives reports of earnings for the U.S. working population each year. Earnings data are used to administer the Social Security programs and to conduct research on the populations served by those programs. The administrative needs of SSA and other agencies have changed over time and as a result there have been numerous changes to the main source of SSA\'s earnings data which is known as the Master Earnings File (MEF). By documenting the history content limitations complexities and uses of the MEF (and data files derived from the MEF) this article serves as a resource for researchers who use earnings data to study work patterns and their implications. It is also a resource for policymakers and administrators who must understand the data used in administering current-law programs and the data available to inform potential changes to those programs.

Summary Earnings Record (SER)
ser_sipp_ext_1984-2008.sas7bdat
A SER record summarizes all earnings information found in the MEF for each year from 1951- present. All amounts reported on W-2s for jobs subject to FICA tax are added together by year and then capped at the FICA taxable maximum. Thus the SER would contain the same value for total FICA earnings if a worker earned $30000 from a single job in one year or $30000 from three separate $10000 jobs in one year. Any amount earned beyond the FICA taxable maximum is not recorded.

Detailed Earnings Record (DER)
der_sipp_ext_1984-2008.sas7bdat
The DER contains individual entries for every W-2 form reported for a worker. In the above example the DER would contain three separate entries for each $10000 job. The DER is a person-year-EIN file where the EIN is the employer\'s tax identifier. The DER reports earnings from Box 1 of the W-2 or those earnings subject to income tax and separately deferred wages contributed to a tax-exempt retirement account. DER earnings are uncapped but are missing some amounts such as earnings deducted to pay health insurance premiums.

 abstract= {The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Protected Identification Key (PIK) Crosswalks are used to link NCVS microdata files to other microdata files with a PIK variable.

The NCVS provides national level personal victimization and property crime rates from a general population sample. Data are gathered on types and incidence of crime; monetary losses and physical injuries due to crime; characteristics of the victims; and where appropriate characteristics of the offender. Periodically the survey includes separate supplements on additional topics such as crime in schools excessive use of force during contacts with law enforcement identity theft stalking and crime in the workplace. More recently numerous series of questions were added to the NCVS questionnaire to obtain information on important current issues such as crime against persons with disabilities hate-related victimizations and identity theft.

Each housing unit selected for the NCVS remains in the sample for three years with each of seven interviews taking place at 6-month intervals. An NCVS interviewer\'s first contact with a housing unit selected for the survey is in person. Throughout the years the mode of interviewing for the subsequent interviews (second through seventh) was changed to cut data collection costs. Currently all subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone whenever possible.

In order to be able to rotate part of the sample in and out every six months the sample is divided into six groups or rotations. Each rotation is then broken up into six pieces to spread the field workload over the six month period. A panel consists of one piece (one sixth) of each rotation group and is interviewed each month of the six month period.

To elicit more accurate reporting of incidents the NCVS uses the self-respondent method which calls for the direct interviewing of each person 12 years or older in the household with certain exceptions.},
